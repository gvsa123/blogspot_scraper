       " \"December probably isn't the time for it, but I'm looking for another job at the moment. This job was only ever meant to be a stepping stone  - a way back into things — temporary cover that I knew would come to an end, but I feel quite anxious now that it is - anxious about what the next step will be. Not sure which way to turn again. Not sure I'm tough-headed or tough-hearted enough to go back to a career in law full-time, even if that were possible. But not sure what else I can do. It's hard knowing what you're cut out for. \\n\",\n",
       " \"Sometimes I give in to dreams —  dream that one day I'll go on to write other books. Books that I'll be proud of this time. I'm not exactly ashamed of 'Abandoned', I know from the emails I get that my story has resonated with a lot of people, that it has helped some. But because the details of my background are in it, the sometimes graphic details of things that happened (that I would never tell a single soul face to face, even the most intimate friend would never get more than a clue. Things that I would never have them know about me outside of this book - things that I almost spat out of me like a bad taste in the mouth as I wrote, and which it was probably necessary to do to move on. But that was only because it was anonymous, I didnt have to censor myself, worry about how much others could cope with, it was just straight out, that little girl screaming her unscreamed scream. It is not a book I can look people in the eye and admit to being proud of having written. Not yet anyway.... But in writing this book, in the actual process, I have discovered how much I love writing. I'd love to go on to do more of it one day. I realise that is just a dream, but there have to be dreams... If I could do something useful that way though, somehow connect with others through something I write one day then I think I would finally be happy in my own skin. Some people would say that is another form of retreat from the world, but I don't think so...maybe I have just found something I love.\\n\",\n",

       " \"I stopped off at a shop yesterday morning, on the drive back, and had a very surreal moment. My book was there on one of the shelves and just as I walked past a woman came along took it down from the shelf and after reading the back cover and skimming several pages, went off to buy it. I couldn't believe it. What are the chances of that happening? Not only the having a book up there at all, but actually standing there as someone takes it down and starts to read it. For a moment I was stunned. I immediately picked up another book and pretended to be reading, but when she turned out of sight I actually walked off after her. It was Monday morning and there was hardly anyone about and I found myself wanting to walk past her and whisper something. I didn't know whether I wanted to say 'thank you for buying my book,' or 'put that down, don't read that, you look far too respectable and decent to know about those kind of thing,' or just  to tell her that it was my book she had in her hands, wanting to say something, \\n\",\n",
       " 'anything...\\n',\n",
       " \"Of course I didn't. But it was a very strange moment. I hurried out into the rain, cold and shaky, shocked at what I had almost blurted out, and at the chances of actually seeing someone there reading my bookcover. And very confused by my own reaction to both.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Who knows, one of the emails I get one day might actually be from her. Though now I'll never know...\\n\",\n",
       " \"If you felt someone watching you from a distance for those few minutes in a supermarket yesterday, after you had just picked up my book, someone acting strangely behind you, half-turned away, trying to be invisible but clearly wanting to say something, it was probably me — me feeling a million things at once; but trying to pluck up the courage to say 'thank you for reading my book.'\\n\",\n",
       " \"I'd almost forgotten about Monday mornings!  Not a good day today, feel less than solid. Thoughts of Christmas and the paperback being out and the possibilty of one of my family one day seeing it, batted around inside my head all day. \\n\",\n",
       " 'God I need you. Keep me strong, surround me with good.\\n',\n",
       " 'Thank you God, for seeing me through all this and the strength to get through it.\\n',\n",
       " \"The paperback being out has unsettled me. I feel like layers have been peeled away from me again.  I feel all at sea. Today I  felt that most of my strength during the writing of the book and after had been pretense, really. It's just that I hadn't tested it so much. When does the pretense become real? When do you walk out of the house in the morning with your head held high and your shoulders back and feel that the ground is firm under your feet?\\n\",\n",
       " \"It was difficult to concentrate at work today. I found distraction in everything. I kept staring out of the window trying to catch the clouds changing shape, or found myself standing in the kitchen down on the first floor staring out at the long lawns at the backs of the houses across the way. Towards the back of one of them there's a moss-covered bench beneath a beautiful maple tree with  big, beautifully-shaped red and gold leaves the colour of flames. The rest of the lawn has been raked, and is clear and green, but the area behind is still thickly carpeted with gold and russet leaves fallen from the taller trees at the back of the garden. I looked a few times today before I saw what else was there. Curled up, just to the left of the bench, right there in the open, almost the same colour as the leaves, was a big fox asleep in the leaves.  Just curled there, happy as you like, in the middle of the day, at the back of a garden in a busy area of London. I kept going down to check throughout the afternoon, and he would be turned in different directions, but still curled up in a ball, his head tucked into his tail. It made me think of waking at night in the car, raising myself from the sleeping bag to get a sip of water or pull the layers tighter around myself and staring up out of the windscreen at the tall thin trees towering up like sticks of charcoal into the black sky, and several times seeing foxes coming back at night, trotting silently up the dark laneway, in twos or threes. Sometimes their red eyes would stare directly at me for long seconds before they disappeared off into the trees. Never seen one during the day like that though, just laying there. Almost the exact same colour as the autumn leaves.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I haven't written here for a while. I've been trying to let things settle and to think forwards rather than backwards all the time, which checking this blog makes me down. Obviously I had to do that while I was writing the book, think backwards, wade through all that past, all that heavy sludge of childhood emotion.  I felt like a spring recoiling on itself. But once the book was finished it was time to try to go forward again. It's what we all have to do, but exactly what I hadn't been doing for so long. I'd gotten stuck. So these past few weeks I've tried to think forwards, and put all the past behind me. But the paperback is out tomorrow, so for a while I can see that will be difficult to do.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I've still been writing, lots of writing, but all of it in notebooks, scribbled on the bus on the way to work or in cafes over lukewarm teas at lunchtime. Sometimes it feels like the start of a poem or a story, but mostly it is just words, grounding words, anchoring me to the day. I don't think I could get through a day without writing something now...But being back at work changes everything. \\n\",\n",
       " \"There's no time for anything anymore. Even on days off I still find myself thinking about work or washing or ironing or tidying, or making soup or lunches to freeze for lunches or replying to emails. This blog is a funny thing...even though I have never met any of you and never will (for obvious reasons - despite some lovely invitations- thank you), I am aware of talking to real people at times, then other times it is exactly like thinking aloud, and sometimes it is like a mixture of the two. Sometimes, something that happens during the day strikes me and I say 'that'll be a nice thing to tell people on the blog....' Even if it's just about fighting the urge to kick up the piles of leaves noisily on the way to work, imagining myself laughing loudly as I mow through them. Or seeing the beautiful imprints of big, golden sycamore leaves on the pavements as I walk up from the bus each morning, the early autumn streets overnight paved with gold. One morning, weeks ago, the pavement was full of those leaves, crunchy yellow and gold, then the rain came and for days soaked through them, and when it stopped and the leaves were blown or swept away, gold-brown 'leaf-stain' was left underneath on the pavement. Beautiful, clear patterns, like ghost-leaves, were left, as far up as the eye could see. They're still there, beneath the city grime. Every day they get a bit fainter, but the pavement on the hill up to where I work is full of beautiful, feint, leaf pattern. The streets already holding their memory of autumn. \\n\",\n",
       " \"Seeing things like that makes the walk to work less dull, and one day last week it lifted my spirits so much that I decided to write a blog about it when I got back. But when it comes to the end of the day, I switch on the computer and am so tired I stare glassy-eyed at the blog and I've either forgotten about what I was going to write, or it suddenly doesn't seem interesting. I start telling myself that nobody wants to read about somebody else's day at work when they get home from their own, or about ghost-leaves on pavements... And I end up convincing myself to wait until I have something more interesting to write.  \\n\",\n",
       " \"But apart from work, nothing much else has happened. Well... I shouldn't say that: I'm not living as I did anymore, so that has happened! I'm now in the warm. And I've told the most intimate details of my life in a book, that's an enormous thing to have happened. But you all know that already... It still feels strange that I have done that. And it's still hard to accept the emails I get from people telling me how inspiring my story has been, or how it has helped them— even if it is just to appreciate what they have, or simply to stay positive, or to see that there is always a way out, or just to open their eyes to the lives of someone around them.\\n\",\n",
       " \"It's difficult to take on board that somehow my life, when I was at my lowest ebb living in my car, and especially the bits of my childhood that I have been so ashamed of, have somehow gone on to help others. Very odd. Somedays, I still have extremely mixed feelings about telling my own story, wrestling with the rightness or wrongness of it. But when I get those emails, when people tell me how much the book has helped them, even people who ordinarily wouldn't read this kind of book, I can't help feeling a little bit...?? maybe even a little bit proud...?? A little bit like this was what I was meant to do — tell the story that so many other people do not have the words or wherewithall or opportunity to tell. It hasn't been a nice story to tell, but hearing other people's stories has made me appreciate how lucky I was too, in many ways.  I lived two lives in one through my childhood, and not many people do that, both of them in tandem. Yes, I had that childhood, and ended up homeless living in my car on the streets of London not far from where I grew up, but in between I lived a very different life, one which some people would see as being full of priviledge: boarding school, with summers in a riding school or up in the hills above Florence in Italy, university, law school, some good jobs, living in Hampstead with other professionals, never thinking about it but if I did \\xa0feeling nothing but entitled. My childhood was way, way back there in the past. But on some level it is still there, and I don't make the right choices as an adult and end up where I ended up. Maybe that was enevitable, but anyone who knew me as a young woman, a young professional in London starting a life wouldn't have seen it coming. I was a bit 'reserved' some would say, not as adventurous as I should have been, trying to conceal some residual/innate shyness, but they would'nt have guessed at my background. Maybe I was meant to write my story, maybe that's why I survived intact. So that I could tell the story so many others can't tell —  stories need to be told, they are what connect us, and what sometimes heal us. So even though it did take falling to the bottom rung of the ladder, with a breakdown and a period of homelessness living in my car to finally get the words out, maybe, in finally getting my story out, I did what I was supposed to do on some level.\\n\",\n",

I intended posting them here so I'd have a constant reminder. But I've just remembered that my main resolution last year was not to do any 'shoulds' at all from now on. So, hopefully, at the stroke of midnight tonight, I'll be resolving just to keep positive and to keep going forward —\\xa0which is what I want most from myself next year. I've got what feels like the start of flu, so if I can keep awake for it, I'll be seeing the New Year in tonight with a pint of Lemsip and some soluble Aspirin to bring my temperature down  —  but there's not a hint of complaint in that, because I was part of a new friend's great, family Christmas this year and I know the coming year will be a good one. \\n\",\n",

But looking out of the window everything was white and beautiful and brilliant, the sun like pearl behind white sky and everything glittered with frost. It looked magical. I love mornings like this. I went to a pantomine the night before last, and the fairy godmother in it was fantastic, really throwing herself into the part, tip-toeing around the cast waving her wand and whispering good into everyones ears. That's what it felt like this morning, waking up to all this whiteness, as if someone had tiptoed through the night -  over rooftops and hills, through the trees, up and down streets and alleyways and parks, waving a magic wand, turning the land this clean, silvery-white.  I felt happy just laying there thinking it. I turned up the music on the CD alarm —  tugged the duvet around me and lay there, staring out at the bare trees on the horizon behind all those misty layers of white half dreaming. One part of my mind though wanted to yank me back to thoughts of Christmas — Christmas that will always and ever be family, no matter how long you've been estranged. It's always hard not seeing Mummy, but there's an added ache through Christmas, and the wondering if I should try to build bridges, at least with her — pick up the phone just to make contact, to see how she is and just hear her voice. But my uncle is still there, and most of my cousins have now married - so there are new husbands and wives and friends in the family who know nothing about me or the past. As a family they have moved on, and after such a struggle in childhood they are now all doing well, in reasonably good jobs and enjoying their lives. They want to make sure it stays that way, and I am a skeleton in the cupboard they dont want out. So even if I could visit it could never be anything more than a charade anyway, and me never anything but a victim of that. I can't be that anymore. But maybe this might be the year to change things.\\n\",\n",
       " \"This year, now that my book is out, it feels even more difficult. Every part of me dreads finding out \\xa0if Mummy, or any of the others, have come across the book, dreads knowing any upset I've caused by bringing it all out into the open.... I changed all their names and wrote it under a pseudonymn but she knows it all happened, she was there at the police station that Saturday all those years ago.... But the mind has to do funny things to survive and maybe she managed to somehow wipe out the details? Maybe she had to to have him back in her life, to carry on for the sake of the other children, his children. Also, she knows nothing about my living in the car, about my breakdown and all those months out there, none of that. If they do know by now, my getting in touch would just make it worse - I think everday that one of them might find out — every time the phone rings my heart stops.\\n\",\n",
       " \"But what if they haven't read it...maybe I could just say hello to her, meet her on her own somewhere without my uncle or anyone else knowing? But I couldn't answer even the most basic questions now without lying. I'd have to say I've been getting on with life all this time, just doing the ordinary things...I couldn't mention anything about the book or how I ended up in the car, or any of this... And what if I did that and she found out about the book sometime later? Surely that deception would feel as bad or worse? I've fallen asleep thinking about it all for weeks now in the run up to Christmas —  almost tormenting myself — should I, shouldn't I? At least send her flowers. Could I, couldn't I ?...Family never go away, never — especially at this time of year, no matter how long you've been apart, or how distant they are. But this morning I managed to pull my mind back to the frost, the glittering, hard frost covering everything, and that fairy godmother in the pantomine the other night in her pink, satin high-heel shoes tip-toeing through the night spreading magic, until all I sensed were her whispered, positive words, and all I could see were footsteps in the frost going forward.\\n\",\n",

Definitely tempting to go back to bed... But for a while I stood there, chewing mindlessly, watching a pair of magpies hopping about next-door's lawn. Then just as my eyes finally adjusted to all the grey, two tiny, colourful little birds flew through the drizzle onto a birdtable in the garden at the other side. I don't know what they were, but seeing them there among all that grey made me smile. They were soft, minky-brown little things, with flashes of yellow on their breasts and bright red faces. Tiny like tits, but not tits...Beautiful splashes of colour brightening up the monochrome.  There was something quite clownish about them. Their faces looking like they had just been dipped in bright red paint...And, on a morning like this morning, just before they flew off again skimming the hedges, it was easy to think they might have been designed just to bring a smile to my face.\\n\",\n",

But I crave the company of like-minded people too. But now that I have the application form for a 'real' writers' retreat, it seems a bit self indulgent to want to go off somewhere just to write. I might feel differently if it ever did happen — because you have to apply quite far in advance, a year or more ahead sometimes - and, by then, who knows what I'll be thinking...maybe I'd be all fired up for it again by then.  But I'm also beginning to wonder whether I was motivated by the right thing — maybe 'real' work should continue to take priority over everything for now.

From this distance all the scaled-down, matchbox-sized  landmarks stretching across from the towers and cranes of Canary Wharf and the dome of St Paul's along to the long misshapen pole of the Post Office Tower, and there, slowly turning through the trees, the big, bright bangle of the London Eye poking up from somewhere down on the Thames.

       " \"As I wrote that I just remembered something about Asia, some connection to when I was in the car. While I was sleeping across the front seats of the car in the laneway all those months, at one point, I can't remember exactly when, but at almost the coldest bit of it I seem to remember, there was an earthquake in the Philippines. Catastrophic destruction. Every morning I'd turn the key in the ignition to listen for a few minutes on the car radio to news of the mud slide disaster — to how whole villages had been wiped out, generations of families gone overnight. Morning after morning there would be reports of how many more homeless people there were now in these villages in the Philippines each day. The Phillipines had always seemed a milllion miles away for me before, tiny squiggles on a map, just a name, a geographical plural. But during those cold weeks I felt such a connection to them somehow. And as the traumatised voices of survivors filled the car each morning, or accounts of them were given, telling how they had not only lost their homes and all they had, but had lost their people too: mothers, husbands, children, friends, grandparents, lovers, all gone in an instant, it made me realise how lucky I was in a way.  I know that sounds bizarre: I was homeless, completely on my own, had broken down (probably), and was living in my car, and I thought my own loss seemed unending, but it made me realise that I didn't have to deal with the enormity of their loss all at the same time. Not only were they homeless and had their dreams wiped out in an instant, but some of them were having to deal with the grief of losing all their loved ones at the same time. It was near the end of my time living in the car and I had almost shut down completely, but somehow something far worse that was happening over in the Philippines got me thinking again, and got me feeling something other than my own pain.\\n\",\n",

And whenever I thought I couldn't manage for another day or another moment I would think of all those people who had had their lives blown apart and say to myself  'At least you have a car to sleep in, Anya, they don't even have that.' So what many of you have said in emails about my story making you see your own problems in more perspective, I can understand. I don't think anyone's problems are really bigger or smaller than others', but I know that feeling. I know it because waking up to news about the disaster in the Phillipines all those mornings is what got me through some days too. It taught me that there is always something better and something worse.... Even when you think things can't get worse, there is always, always something worse happening somewhere. What was happening all those thousands of miles away in the Philippines was much worse than how I had ended up, living in my car...at least I had a car to sleep in. And I had public libraries and access to a blog to tell whoever might stumble across it one day about my story. I could never have imagined that a journalist from the New York Times would be the one to stumble across it— and from that hundreds of people would read my blog and that there would be a book and then this, or that one day I would be out of the car, and that again the Philippines would come into my story....\\n\",\n",

Maybe he was part of the invisible weft of my life, as others through connecting with this blog or my book have become, and I part of theirs.  I'm not quite sure what I'm trying to say here, it's just that sometimes you think you start to see the seams of life — the way things are all joined up, meanings and purposes behind things, how everything is connected. It comes, it goes — and I don't think anyone ever does ever quite see them, but I hope I never give up believing that they are there: that somehow things are connected, and for a purpose, and that there is some design in all this, some method in what sometimes just seems like madness.\\n\",\n",

I don't know why, I loved it from the start, for all sorts of reasons...one of them being the close-up-ness of the writing, he doesn't pan out much, he has the lens right up there, close to whatever he is describing.  So if he writes about a woman in a long red coat wearing a black velvet cloche hat you see her standing there - very visual, you can 'see' everything he writes about as he travels halfway across the world following migrating geese to their nesting places, and his own internal compass leading him back home. It wouldn't be for everyone, it's a very slow, quiet, but evocative, beautiful, beautiful book.

Just one thing she said at the end of the book about all the changes she has gone through by the book's end, how much she has grown as a person. And she said something which has stayed with me for days....About her growing as a person. She used the analogy of an acorn becoming an oak tree. She said the way she has come to see it is there isn't just one force at work (the acorn pushing to become an oak tree) but two (also the oak tree being there already somewhere willing the acorn on to become the oaktree it already is - on some plane). She says, what if it's not just her younger, weaker self pushing on to become the stronger one she ended up as, but what if  the woman she was always going to grow into was there already (somewhere) drawing her on to become her — The older you already there somewhere waiting for the younger you to push towards it.  I may have got that idea a bit muddled - I've read a few other books in between — but it was something like that. It was a powerful idea that I hadn't heard expressed like that before; and for some reason it stayed with me. So I thought I'd put it here.

I didn't have an address for them to get in touch to let me know - as you know....

A wooden pelmet, with three carved spirals along it, grey with clogged dust, came a few inches down over the top shelf and one of the front legs was shorter than the other requiring a wad of wedged-under paper to stop the wobble.

Maybe my response is because it deals with homelessness and surviving on the edges of society - things which are still fresh in my mind; and so I feel I could have written something similar from experience rather than imagination. In places it almost feels like writing-by-numbers, which after the brilliance of Music and Silence I almost don't dare write.

Who am I to say though - it was definitely a moving read, and kept me engaged with the characters and wanting to know what happened next right to the end. And Rose Tremain is Rose Tremain — every line of her should be read, and I couldn't even dream of writing that well. It has even won the Orange prize for fiction, so what do I know....Maybe you need a book like that to come along to give you that extra bit of confidence that you can do it yourself... Or maybe the craft always shows through the story when you look for it as closely as I have probably been doing since I put my own story into words - something, subconsciously, I had probably been 'writing' in my head my whole life, since childhood. Anyway, it has confirmed the fact that I want to write more than I want to do anything. Nothing comes closer to that feeling of sitting alone in a room and loosing yourself in writing and it all coming together... I want to do that more than anything.

Which at the time I thought was a very strange message, even though that is what I have always tended to do in my life. I was a bit disappointed in a way, of all the things that angels could tell you....especially me in the lost state I was in at the time. She also gave me the name of my two guardian angels. Names which weren't in English, but which, even though I was sceptical of the whole thing anyway, I still found a bit unsettling seeing written down in the letter. She said all I needed to do was call the name and ask them to come down and they would.  I remember rolling the sounds of their names around my tongue and for a few days finding myself silently saying them.

As I reached up to straighten it,  I instinctively read the title, and then my eyes shot up to the author's name. Because suddenly I knew who it was. And as I read the authors name I saw it was her.

It's a book about a lady who lived in her van in Alan Bennett's driveway before she died! One day, (as you do at the beginning in a kind of surreal dream I Googled myself -  'Wanderingscribe' —  and in amongst the surreal 'woman living in her car' articles, and references to Wanderingscribe, and all the dross from disgusting trolls, I came across the book by Alan Bennett.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I bought it the very next day. It is a slim volume, and of course I read it in one sitting, transfixed... She wasn't like me at all; the Lady he writes about was a real bag lady, who had lived like that for years - though who knows that I might not have turned out like that under other circumstances. Anyway, I went on to read lots of Alan Bennett in the end, this way or that way. His name seemed to generally cross my path — as it does when you come across something new: I'd go into a bookshop and there it'd be, a book by Alan Bennett on the table or the counter, or a picture of him on the book jacket or some publicity flyer. He writes plays too, he wrote the 'History Boys', which was turned into the film. You can't help knowing what he looks like, his image is almost as famous as his words. And I remember going to the Southbank one evening for a reading of 'Nocturnes' by Kazio Ishiguru. And in one of the other theatres must have been something on by Bennett because there in the corner was a lifesize cardboard cut out of him. The long coat, the green scarf, the shirt and tie under a high v-neck, the black specs, the newly cut hair, that boyish grin. It could have been him standing there in the corner, life-size, watching the comings and goings in the foyer. Anyway, it's an image everyone is probably familiar with, iconic almost. \\n\",\n",
       " \"A few months after that, I went out for the day to London, a place where there is a large park and, nearby, lots of smart cafes. As I was choosing between cafes,  walking towards me, looking very pleased with himself, grinning that grin, was Alan Bennett. Larger than life, pushing a bike, with a bunch of yellow flowers tucked in the crook of one arm, and a couple of A4 writing pads under the other. Can you imagine that - of all the things he could be carrying, he actually was carrying writing paper! Just walking towards me as if he had walked straight out of one of his own book jackets, Writing Home\\xa0or that cardboard cut-out I saw at the Southbank. Except he was surprisingly taller than you'd imagine from the photos.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I haven't been to that place since. Until the week before last. Again I was out for the day, and schlepped from the train along to one of those cafes. This time I had some writing in my bag, and so hurried there, determined to make inroads on the novel I have long wanted to write (nothing to do with my own story, that's done I never want to write any part of my own story again! But that doesn't mean I don't want to write, ever since I wound a piece of white paper into my first Petite typewriter as a child - turquoise in its plastic turquoise case- I have wanted to write. A motivation which may well have come from my own story - difficult childhoods or periods in childhood have probably formed countless writers - but I never thought I'd write my own story - and if it wasn't for the situation I was in I never would have. I chose my cafe, staked a claim at an outside table, ordered a coffee and then wandered down to the bookshop further along to get a book.\\n\",\n",
       " \"The bookshop owner commented that he personally knew the author whose book I ended up buying. It wasn't Alan Bennett, but was apparently one of their neighbours. 'His children go to school with our children. He often pops in...' he said. It felt a good omen to have the author I had bought as a local. And as he said it, it reminded me of the writer I had seen the last time I was there. I had it in mind to tell him my Alan Bennett story: that the very last time I was here, all those months ago, I saw him, walking down the street towards me, pushing his bike with those yellow flowers in the crook of one arm, the writing pads under the other. I didn't tell him though. But as I walked out into drizzle and down to drink the coffee already waiting on the table, I had that  image firmly in my head. It was as clear as if he was there again, slowly walking towards me along that same stretch of pavement,  in that long coat and scarf, those yellow flowers, and then past me, walking on wheeling his bike, as if walking through a Hovis advert, that expression on his face as if he was laughing at a continuous inner stream of jokes as he went along.\\n\",\n",
       " \"I forgot about the image. I drank my coffee. I lost myself in the writing. The words came so well in the end that I didn't dare break the spell and decided to stay and have a second coffee. I went inside to order at the counter at the far end of the deep cafe, and as the waiter wiped cappuccino pipes and frothed milk in a metal jug,  I turned around and who was walking down the long aisle towards the counter...but Alan Bennett!\\n\",\n",
       " \"I did a double take, cleared my vision by staring blankly at the waiter, and then glanced around again and there he was, still there. No yellow flowers under either arm.... I gave a cautious, probably very stunned, half-smile of aknowledgement, which he returned with that boyish grin.  He then almost dropped himself into a chair at the small table by the counter, and waited to order. Seeing him sitting there, Alan Bennett dressed as Alan Bennett, was like looking at the cover of a book and again it made me smile.  It was table service, so sitting at that small table by the counter, he could only have been there for takeaway.  I tried not to say hello. I tried hard...but in the end I couldn't help myself. I said in one breath, 'I know I shouldn't speak to you...' at which he waved a hand and said 'no, that's fine' which I spoke over anyway saying '...but it's almost like I just summoned you up, because I was literally just thinking of you as I walked along from the bookshop.... ' He threw his head back and laughed heartily when I said that, and I told him about nearly telling the man in the bookshop about seeing him last time I was in the area too, and how instead, just twenty minutes or so ago, I'd carried his image in my head all the way back down the street to my waiting coffee. I didn't tell him that I was there to write that day, that I'd taken my book bag with me and was writing for the first time in I don't know how long...and then I think of him coming from the bookshop and turn at the counter and there he is walking up and queuing beside me for a coffee! Amazing! On the day I blow the dust off my notepad as well...Hopefully a good omen. \\n\",\n",
       " \"I wished I'd said more...I wish I'd been able to say more: 'Can I walk with you, Mr Bennett, talk to you about  writing?'  The things he could have told me...the tips, the advice. I think mostly I wanted to tell him that I lived in my car too, like the woman he wrote about, and that I wrote about it too. That maybe I wrote for her, Mrs Shepherd. He wrote about her living in her van from his perspective, imagined what she felt, why she was there, maybe I wrote her side of things, or a not too dissimilar version of it maybe...? Maybe I'm how it starts, the Mrs Shepherd thing. Maybe she was how it could have ended. There but for the grace of God...\\n\",\n",
       " \"But of course I couldn't have told him any of that...He did chat for a few minutes though as we waited for coffee. He was relaxed and approachable, with this great avuncular charm about him. He told me he used to live in Gloucester Place, and in the 60's lived in a flat around the corner from where we were, which he loved so much he wished he had back.  When my coffee was ready,  I could either hang around like some groupie or go back to my table outside. I wanted to hang around talk to him, about anything, just be in such a nice aura for a bit. But of course I said how nice it was to meet him and went back to my table outside. Minutes later I saw him walk away in the other direction with his takeaway coffee, the long coat swinging as he walked off home. In a way I'm still kicking myself for not talking to him, for there not being a way to do that. I wonder what he would have made of a chance meeting in a cafe as they stood waiting for coffee between (what I became known as at the time as) 'the woman who lived in her car' and the man who wrote The Lady Who Lived in a Van.\\n\",\n",

I didn't know he was my father then, he was just a glamourous, gentle stranger who always wore a suit and tie and arrived from Ireland every few months bringing presents and laughter and who picked me out for special attention. One of my earliest memories is of him arriving unexpectedly at our flats in a shiny new red hire car from the airport, coming like a movie star into our lives, taking me off for 'a spin' without any of my cousins, or slipping me out of that world to have lunch with him in a marble-floored hotel in the 'West End' as he called it.

Car journeys in particular brought out the poetry in him - on all those spontaneous visits to see us all in London, or, later, the long drives to and from both boarding schools. And Innisfree was one of his favourite Yeat's poems. As I got older and\\xa0became the cheeky, (slightly) rebellious teenager (which in retrospect I see he encouraged - almost created as a balance to the earlier part of my childhood...). His endless reciting (instead of answering my stack of 'why's' about their decisions about my life, once I discovered he was my father) would often infuriate me. I would sit in the back, a stroppy teenager gazing out over endless green countryside pretending not to listen. But somehow the poetry got in and passed on. I wasn't even sure I knew all the words to this poem. Until in the church seeing his daughters and granddaughters go up one by one to give a reading or pay tribute I realised I needed to say a public goodbye too. So in the cemetry I asked the priest if I could have the microphone and was surprised at my memory as every word of 'Innisfree' tumbled out. \\xa0'That's where I'll go when it's all over' he always said 'and live alone in a bee-loud glade (which he claimed was one of the finest lines of any poem). I don't know if his other daughters knew Innisfree\\xa0or had poetry threaded through their childhoods the way I did - I think we all had our own Brendan. I like to think he would have been proud of me standing there in the cold the other day reciting it from memory down to his coffin.\\n\",\n",

I'm not even sure that's possible, and especially with all those kids and sleeping in the van in rest stops on the way here.  But the 17 year old daughter who is a mother said it only took them three days, two nights.  We got them settled in a cheap hotel for a few nights, gave them a list of resources.  We filled their tank with gas (the father dodged into the quickie-mart and got a job app!).  I don't know how they physically survived.  I put four of the kids into my car for the run to the hotel, and still their van was crowded.  They made quite an impression; half of them were bare footed when they got into the dispatch center.  What are they thinking?  And more importantly, where will they go today?        \\n\",\n",

For Christians this is a season of reflection, repentance, and renewal, marked by giving up some indulgence -- like fat for instance.  (Suddenly I\\'m regretting the bacon burger I ate for lunch!)  I\\'m giving up computer games, and propose to myself to use the time for better and more productive pursuits.  Anyway, I spent the evening downtown with another minister, visiting a bar, hanging out on the sidewalk talking to revelers and greeting public officials who have also made a tradition of hanging out on Fat Tuesday, since the riot of 2001 and the death of a young man in a general street brawl.  Two construction managers for a major national company dominated our time and attention for over an hour.  They were amazed that we were in a bar -- one thought it was an act of God.  Before we showed up they were debating about the Trinity.  The active Catholic guy was trying to explain it to his tipsy lapsed Lutheran.  After hearing our explanation they were both satisfied and amazed.    In the course of this conversation a humble homeless guy presented himself with a hypothetical.  \"What if an out-of-work fisherman had no place to go for the night?  Could something be done?\"  Lutheran guy hands the enquirer $5, I made a quick call to determine the availability of shelter, and found him a spot in a shelter.    On the way to the shelter \"Bobby\" told a tale of woe -- out of control with alcohol, and worse, he doesn\\'t think God wants anything to do with a \"heathen like me.\"  He is mourning the loss of his family, two sons were killed, one in Desert Storm in 1991, the other in Iraq last August.  While he wept I prayed for him to have faith, and to find the strength to move one step closer to sobriety and wholeness.  After this dramatic moment, I returned to Pioneer Square.    Here were groups of men trying to induce women to show their breasts for the sake of a few cheap strings of plastic beads.  Many of the young women were wearing provacative clothing.  Not much needed to happen for them to be appreciated by the lustful crowds.  Honestly, it wasn\\'t very distracting.  Most of the women walking around were women who frankly would not have garnered much male attention otherwise -- plain faces and rotund builds.  I found myself repulsed but intrigued.  Difficult not to look -- like watching a car wreck in some cases.  One Rubenesque 20-something covered her face in shame as we walked past.  \"I\\'ve gotta go to confession!\" she howled.    I was given a few strands of beads which ended up around the neck of our mayor and police chief.  A memorable night.  Rick \\n',\n",

The area is bordered by public housing, and the parking building for Harborview Hospital.We walked toward the waterfront, trying to imagine the old growth timber which would be shoved down to the waterfront along this route (the origin of \"Skid Road\"). At the bottom of the hill we could see City Hall Park at Third & Yesler, where a feeding program was just wrapping up.\"Where you guys from?\" one of the meal patrons asked.\"I\\'m from Operation Nightwatch, and I\\'m taking this group of kids from Wenatchee out on a tour.\"\"I graduated from Eastmont High in Wenatchee.\"Now what are the odds of that?

In the middle of the game I started talking about a book I finished reading: Naked Lunch by William Burroughs.  Can\\'t say I recommend it -- really raw, graphic, horribly disconnected, but instructive about heroin subculture. But almost as soon as the words were out of my mouth, the bartender and another patron were wanting to talk about the book.  We went from beat writers and gonzo journalists to those who were our favorites.  I told them we should come up with a top ten list for the bar.  Kurt Vonnegut was highly regarded, and the bartended named East of Eden by John Steinbeck.  He acknowledged his was an \"erudite\" bar. From Queen Anne we returned downtown to Third and Bell.  The topic of favorite writers continued -- a homeless friend was reading a pot boiler -- he said he didn\\'t like it really, but he always finishes what he starts.   Pastor Dave played pool.  The bartender kicked a few people out -- lots of drugs in the neighborhood, and people are coming in to attempt to use the bathroom or make a connection.

It looks like My Favorite Tavern is undergoing a huge face lift.  Hope all the regulars are okay.  Wonder if they miss me at all on Thursday nights?  Not sure why, but I just didn\\'t have the starch to go hunting for everyone at Interbay or whereever they\\'re hanging out now.  (next week next week).  Headed down to 3rd and Bell.  Seems like a whole new ball game in Belltown lately, more trafficking than usual, or maybe it\\'s just that I\\'m having to walk farther from the tavern than I used to, thanks to the night club scene picking up.  Belltown is the new Pioneer Square (not so new actually -- I did a public walk in 1995 to draw attention to the drug problems -- enforcement seems a little pointless perhaps.  Walking around in a clerical collar sure draws the paranoid stares. In fact, last week these two women about broke their necks looking at me after coming out of the tavern here.)At 3rd and Bell I spent time with R #3 and The Man with No Identity.  R#3 wanted to talk theology -- \"Why I\\'m not a Roman Catholic.\"  Since I knew the Man with No Identity was a cradle Catholic I didn\\'t want to rise to the bait.  Besides I had business -- trying to establish the identity for the Man with No Identity.  We agreed to get together the next day.  (ed. -- I hauled him over to Gethsemane Lutheran http://www.urbanfaith.org/ where they have a worker Jan who helps with ID.  But even she was stumped.)  And that was pretty much my night.  Rick\\n',\n",
       " 'Father Kim & I had a third helper tonight -- Mistie from SD, which could be a mid western state or a city in SoCal.It was a pretty interesting night.  Since my favorite Queen Anne tavern is now CLOSED (oh my gosh, a whole chapter on this next week) we decided to take stuff to Tent City 3, currently located at Church By theSide of the Road (yes, that is its name).  We brought blankets, cups, napkins, a few other necessary items.  These were received with thanks.  I jokingly told them it was a peace offering.   They said, \"Okay, we forgive you\" and then I heard that apparently our night crew at the Shelter Dispatch Center (14th and Main) had run off the Tent City Outreach team when they came recruiting new members.  At least they acknowledged that they should have called first instead of just showing up.  I\\'m sure my crew thought they were just fishing for dinner and didn\\'t have a referral (our usual requirement). The three of us split up and got involved with various conversations.  Mistie was absolutely fearless, which is great for a first-timer.  She would be a great outreach minister.From there we went to Third and Bell.  Most the regulars were absent, the usual bartender was getting a much needed break -- traveling to Reno with the owner as a thank you for working four straight months without a night off.  Bartender \"D\" was back (hey, didn\\'t she fire him once?).  Talked to \"He Who Has No Identity\" about our attempt to get him set up with Social Security as a step to getting him off the street.  Progress is being made through VA and others.It was pretty early, but decided to make an early end of the night.  Got back to the Dispatch Center about 11:15 or 11:30, and there was a maelstrom brewing -- evidently one of the women\\'s shelters had a closure tonight.  No one called us.  Phooey.  There were eight disconsolate/angry women storming around trying to collect themselves.  Half of them marched out with blankets, the other four Father Kim kindly hauled to Tent City 3 for the night.  But they weren\\'t very happy about it.(Ed. note -- the following week we found out that there are two more nights in October when this shelter is scheduled to be closed.  I have sent letters to First Covenant Church, asking them to consider covering these two nights, staffed by the usual staff -- in at 9:30 and out by 7 a.m.  We shall see.  Why the shelter can\\'t figure it out for themselves is beyond me. . . )\\n',\n",
       " 'Father Kim was out of town so I was on my own last night.Had several people invoke my clergy privelege last night -- so I can\\'t really share any of the big news from my favorite Queen Anne bar.  Needless to say it will affect us all; these sorts of events can cause people to seek personal change and growth -- painful, but ultimately good.Had a great visit at Third and Bell, although I\\'ve got tell you, there was a ton of street drug trafficking going on.  All these twitchy people gathering, then suddenly dispersing, and looking at me in a most paranoid fashion.At Third & Bell saw several regulars, though R#3 was AWOL.  I think he should have to call us if he\\'s NOT going to be there.  I don\\'t think he drinks, just likes the company.  Anyway, D.  was thankful I was attempting to assist him.  Not sure if there\\'s anything we can do, his name and birth certificate don\\'t match -- his service record etc all with a name he wasn\\'t born with.  But I suspect after talking with him -- if he had the identification at some point, he can get it again, assuming he\\'s accurate in his info.  We shall see.  He\\'s 65 and sleeps outside and believes he shouldn\\'t anymore.  The last few times I\\'ve seen a little sloppier than I remember  in times past, not sure what to make of it other than the usual progression of the disease.Some guy started chatting me up in the bathroom (hard to describe it as a bathroom, the door is stuck open and the back of your head is clearly visible to the bartender -- in fact when I first went in there last night, she stopped me, turned me around for a hug -- her in the door of the men\\'s room and me inside.  HA.  Anyway, a guy followed me in, and started talking over his shoulder (any guy can explain this if you ask them).  Anyway, he said something like how important it is to do good, and I tried to shape this thought a little -- because I believe it is biblical that we are \"blessed to be a blessing.\"  It wasn\\'t exactly what he meant (probably more like \"what goes around comes around\" or that misunderstood idea of making good karma for oneself).  Anyway we had this little patch of common ground, and I went back out to the bar to my interupted conversation.  Suddenly this hand was thrust into mine with some real folding money.  I was sort of mid thought and didn\\'t really look at what was handed me, and when I finished my sentence,  turned around,  and the dude was gone.  The other patrons thought it was pretty cool that he had done that but when I said something about sending the money to help people in New Orleans, they vetoed it.  \"It\\'s for Nightwatch\" so there you go.Plus another great quote:  \"My mother was Lutheran and my dad was Roman Catholic.  I\\'m a Little Schizophrenic.\"     -- Rick\\n',\n",

       " 'I\\'ve been spoiled the past 6 years with great co-ministers on the street: Father Kim & Pastor Dave. But once in a while I have to hit the bars by myself.Tonight started at the Operation Nightwatch Dispatch Center. Here homeless men, women, and families are fed, comforted and sent off to various shelters. One of the volunteers said they were trying to get groceries donated for the meal they bring to us; I whipped out a letter they could take to the grocery store -- we\\'re a non-profit, and companies like the proof of it.So, got a little later than usual start -- drove by My Favorite (Closed) Queen Anne Tavern. It\\'s still closed. The flock is scattered. I\\'m surprised I haven\\'t found any more of the folks than I have, and a little disappointed that MS Guy or someone hasn\\'t called. Did run into the bar tender -- er, former bar tender. Gave him a ride home, but did he call and say he wanted to work for Nightwatch as a security guy? No. I\\'m bummed. Don\\'t you think there\\'s delicious irony in a former bar tender working for Operation Nightwatch? From here I drove to Interbay -- where things were really happening at the Dravus Street tavern. It was super busy -- a few working girls, some regulars. The place was packed. The Milk Maid barkeep gave me hot lemon water, God bless her. She really really is looking forward to our visits on Thursday nights. \"Scotty\" tried talking to me again. He\\'s been there every time I go in, seems like a little alcoholic psychosis. Even the other patrons keep away. I heard the MM trying to explain him to a concerned customer. He\\'s so foul and twisted that true conversation seems pointless. I wouldn\\'t pursue it.Another customer came to me and confessed to having relapsed, but acknowledging God in his life and the desire to help others. He made some reference to my position and I let him know that he could have an impact on people that I never could because he\\'s been there -- formerly homeless, struggles with alcohol or addiction. I\\'m not sure he got the message but it was a dynamic moment.There continues to be a lot of curiousity about us but a pretty good reception here overall. It\\'s probably the closest bar to Pastor Norm, by the way.From here I went down to 3rd & Bell. Second Gospel working the bar, saw the Man with No Identity and gave him some much needed good news -- his military info had come in, we now have the ability to get him VA picture ID and with that we should be able to get him his social security. It was a bad day -- someone had come to his camp site and stolen his gear -- clothes and everything. He was pretty glum until I told him of my progress.Came back to HQ and heard that we were going to be turning away women again because the idiots that run a women\\'s shelter which was going to be closed for two nights decided that the alternative church basement I set up for them wasn\\'t really needed . . . Arrrgh. Oh boy someone is going to hear about this one. Lovingly. R\\n',\n",
       " 'Another unbelievable night.Started by running four cases of blankets to Seattle\\'s Tent City 3 -- we heard they were low.  There was a total screaming fracas going on at the leadership tent, some woman was yelling in a voice that would fracture cement.  Decided to drop and run.Off to our new Dravus Street bar -- Milk Maid bartender, always seems out of context to me in this rough tough place.   But she likes seeing us, anxious to talk.   A Lumberjack -- big guy in plaid and bad teeth picks up on my church affiliation -- Free Methodist.  He has a story to tell.He grew up Free Methodist, married a Jewish woman.  Their son\\'s Jewish, but his wife isn\\'t observant.  He \"cleans up\" because she wants the Christmas tree and he wants the minorah and Hannukah in the house.After his son was born the Jewish grandmother wants to know, who will do the bris (the ritual circumcision)?Lumberjack looks me right in the face.  \"I did it myself, I told her.  And it\\'s the truth.\"  No, Lumberjack is no mohel.  His physician buddy had done the work, while he said the words of the Covenant over his son.  Hey, it counts.  Onto 3rd & Bell, need to find a wheelchair for R#3 -- his bearing went out. He can still get around with a cane, but when he\\'s tired, it\\'s a bit dicey.  And I\\'ve noticed he\\'s AWOL more often lately (remember, he only drinks coffee).  Second Gospel bartending tonight.  Knew my name.  Sheesh.Rick\\n',\n",
       " 'Did you ever have one of those dreams where people you knew from here, there, and everywhere intruded into your brain. It was like that last night at Third & Bell.Pastor Dave and I returned to the Dravus St. bar looking for evacuees from My Favorite (closed) Queen Anne Tavern. Did not spot anyone, but greeted \"Bartender C\" who seems completely out of context in a pretty rough bar -- she should be pushing milk and cheese products at a country fair, dressed in dirndle skirt. Pastor Dave whipped me at pool (lousy table) and then beat one guy, lost to another. He wanted me to think he threw the game for the sake of the gospel!Back by My Fav. (C) QAT just to make sure nothing was close to happening there. Yup. Dead as a doornail. Why the new owner hasn\\'t posted a sign \"Under New Management, Look for our Grand Reopening . . \" is beyond me.Then I entered a twilight zone. Six significant conversations at 3rd & Bell -- people wandering in that I knew 10 years ago, former homeless people I helped out (arguing about who has known me longer). One meth babe who confessed to being a grandmother (I was watching the face of the 30 year old who HAD been hitting on her -- hehehehe -- sin is often it\\'s own reward). The Man With No Identity received my letter to the senator on his behalf. Tree Hugger K. walked in carrying a gallon of milk (what the!!!) and let me know that he isn\\'t drinking anymore (or did he say, \\'not drinking very much?\\'). At any rate, he walked out of 3rd and Bell with his milk and never had a drop o\\' booze despite hanging out and talking. The 30 year old \"kid\" who had hit on the meth-babe-granny was full of himself; moved out of Belltown (\"I don\\'t have to throw macaroni and cheese out my window onto drug dealers now.\" -- best quote of the night) and lives in Magnolia neighborhood. Good for him. He was pretty stoked. New bartender -- I\\'ll call him 2nd Gospel -- is settling in. I can\\'t remember laughing so much on the street in 20 years.Oh yeah, how could I forget. Bearded Lutheran told me he\\'s now been on the same stretch of I-5 for 15 years (which is consistent with the fact that I first met him 10 years ago and at that time he told me it was 5 years. He inspired me back then to clamber under the freeway to meet people.)We had a wide ranging conversation -- military service and the directions of a person\\'s life given certain pivitol moments and choices we make. Serious stuff. He grew up Missouri Synod Lutheran. Interesting guy. About 20 minutes into this wide ranging conversation he pulls up and says, \"Pray for {me}\" saying his full name. Nothing specific. I assured him I would, and he said, \"I believe you will.\" It was quite a serious moment in a night of hilarity.\\n',\n",
       " 'Since my Favorite Queen Anne Tavern closed down last month, I\\'ve really been at loose ends.  Where is my flock of regulars?  They have to be someplace worshipping at the altar of John Barleycorn!  hehehe.  Anyway, Father Kim and I dropped by a few Interbay places in search of \"Evacuees\" displaced from the FQAT closing.  Yeah!  Right on Dravis Street we found \"J\" former cat lady.  It was sureal.  I was wedged in the bar between her and a guy who seemed to be suffering from alcoholic psychosis.  He was muttering in response to my conversation with J and when I tried to include him, introduce myself, he wanted no part of it.  Fine.\"F---in\\' hold her down and we\\'ll have an exhorcism and I\\'ll pull out her tongue. . .\"  Just the usual bar talk (!)  He must think J is a bit talkative.  hmmm.  Now imagine trying to have a conversation while a drunk is muttering all this, inches from your ear.Bartender is \"Cathy\" -- mother of an orthodox priest, happy to have us in the bar.  Father Kim had a conversation with someone he knew, \"Joel\" works at the local fast food Mexican place where Kim\\'s a regular.  Looks like a return possibility.Third & Bell was quiet -- new bartender  \"M\" and three patrons.

We have become good friends and always have a chat about something.Went to 2B. and had a cup of soup and Pepsi. Got into a long conversation with a fellow I had never met before.

       " 'I decided to go out to visit my bars on Thanksgiving night. This is the first time in 20 years I\\'ve actually tried this, partly to preserve my own sanity and partly to keep the home fires burning. But last week I checked and yes, both the main bars I go to were planning to be open. What do you expect? People to suddenly have a life? Besides, by 10 pm on a holiday a lot of people feel like going out and getting drunk -- thanks to family tension.The Dravus street bar was open -- some recognizable regulars -- though I haven\\'t seen \"J\" for awhile, and Dogboy was AWOL. I miss the lumberjack/mohel. Milk Maid behind the bar described her cooking calamity -- turkey avalanche when the entire oven tipped forward and dropped a bunch of equipment on her, to say nothing of a 350 degree bird. She\\'s gonna be sore tomorrow. Down the bar was a lone guy working on a pitcher. He offered to buy me a beer. I demurred, but came down and sat with him and had a reasonably lucid conversation (one of these days I\\'m going to lay out a system for categorizing bar conversations -- instead of one to five stars they would have to be one to five pint glasses . . . ). This RC patron talked about a family situation. He also had some nice things to say about Nightwatch from years gone by -- apparently he bartended in the area when there were more ministers on the street. God bless him, I was really happy to have had one \"one pint\" type conversation. Made coming out to night worth it. Went on down to 3rd and Bell. \"K\" says he had a fine meal -- cooked himself dinner, ate alone. I gave the \"Man With No ID\" his new Driver\\'s License which arrived this week. He is really ready to move in someplace, hopefully here at Nightwatch. Lots of women from Angelines hanging out -- evidently they come to the bar to wait for their rides to various shelters. Lots of hispanic guys in tonight. \"R\" #3 was gone still, and 3rd Gospel in the bar, looking good. Don\\'t see button down shirts often back there. Silent \"M\" enjoyed the conversation -- some sort of affective disorder -- stroke or something. Another vet.Back at Nightwatch -- a wild man was talking to the martians, but the crew wasn\\'t concerned about him. They deal with him nightly and he doesn\\'t seem to pose a threat to anyone. What a life. In early (midnight home). Rick\\n',\n",
       " 'The \"Man With No Identity\" needs a new blog name, since today, the unbelievable happened. This saga goes back about 4 months. In my efforts to get MWNI off the street, all these obstacles emerged -- wallet stolen (everything missing). Name on his birth certificate different than the name he used in the military. Almost 30 years since he had a Washington State Driver\\'s License. No way to collect Social Security, despite his being 65 years old.We got his service record from the military, and with that, just today, got into the Federal Building (without ID -- sorta Catch22); they escorted us upstairs and within 15 minutes we walked out with Official VA ID Card, complete with picture, signature, date of birth. Yee-Haw. Walking up 2nd Ave. in downtown Seattle, it was surreal. \"I am somebody\" he said. \"Since we\\'re on a roll, let\\'s go get you a Washington State ID card,\" I suggested. He resisted. No way. They\\'re never going to give me that, I tried before.\" C\\'mon, let us try anyway, see what happens.Thirty minutes later we had his temporary Washington State ID, the permanent one comes in three weeks. Unreal. MWNI is now the Man With Identity. Thanks to those who prayed: Luther Memorial Men\\'s Group, Mistie, Dan, Gerard, Jim, and others. Thank God. Rick\\n',\n",
       " 'Happy Veterans Day. Tonight we ran into vets wherever we went, from Operation Nightwatch where staff and volunteers who are vets served homeless vets a meal and found them shelter for the night, to the taverns where we ran into all sorts of interesting vets. At the end of the night at midnight, as the bar closed I went around and checked -- about 80% of the patrons were identified as vets. I thanked them all. Some were quite moved.At the Dravus Street bar I was chided for having missed a week. Last Thursday I was ill (sorry about the lack of updates tsk tsk). Milkmaid missed me. I laughingly told her I had thought about calling in. I haven\\'t run into such an enthusiastic response in any bar in a long time.Met H (no teeth?). Met S. who was in total collapse and finally as the cab came to haul her (him?) out, s/he revealed he was facing a health crisis -- darkly alluded to. I gave him/her my card, said it would look better in the morning, and pushed her out. The gender confusion by the way was all ours. Pastor Dave was sure it was a guy in transition, but I was willing to think S was simply a big lady. The Marine Corps ring was curious though. S. made everyone happy, buying a round. J. played pool with Pastor Dave. K-J asked for prayer. Met K. too. Couldn\\'t get away from her once she started her long rambling tale -- delusional I think, but God love her, she had perfect nails and offered me half her sandwich. Found out that the skinny regular has a street handle -- he greeted me civilly, but then he hadn\\'t been there very long, unlike other visits. Dog-boy? I wonder about the derivation. Can hardly wait to hear him bark. Just hope he doesn\\'t bite. Still no evacuees from our old haunt which continues to be shut down and no sign of a soon-resurrection on Queen Anne Hill.Didn\\'t get to Third and Bell until 11:15 -- despite agreeing to a short stay, Dave got involved in a pool game with R#3 who wasn\\'t too happy with me for my failure to find him a wheelchair (I thought this would be a slam dunk and failed miserably -- then on the way home Dave said his church has two in a closet -- cha-ching!). The Man with No Identity is soon to emerge from the shadows. DDAY is next Tuesday. I found it a little ironic that I\\'m unable to help a homeless vet on Veteran\\'s Day because the Vet\\'s office is closed. Any obstacle can and will be found.The MWNI actually teared up when I told him I was going to call my favorite WW2 vet today -- my dad. MWNI has been an orphan since he was 2 -- a loving grandparent raised him, but he wanted me to know I was truly blessed to have both parents alive. He also made a special point of wishing me a happy holiday.Bartender \"2nd Gospel\" had to unlock the door to let us out at the end of the night. Visited NW staff back in the office after midnight.

The only drug deal I interfered with in 20 years is one involving a guy who used to bring his kids to my church for the free dinner, and I stumbled into the exchange, got my finger under his nose and gave him hell.

We also have the right to refuse service.99% of our friends get it.  They take a bus that gets them here at 9:10, or they hide out someplace closeby until we open at 9:00.  Are we being cruel?  No, we\\'re simply trying to keep peace with neighbors. There is absolutely no advantage to showing up early.  We have plenty of food and goodies.  Last night someone could have waltzed in at 9:45 and not waited in line, gotten all the food and goodies and socks he wanted.So, the night before last some knucklehead was spotted at the bus stop a block away, a good hour before we opened.  He made some case for himself (\"I was helping a woman who was assaulted in a restaurant, you wouldn\\'t want me to let her get murdered like that lady under the viaduct and what kind of Christian ARE you?\") and then proceeded to scream at my staff (I heard it all -- he thought I wasn\\'t around, so when he wrote me a letter it was a pretty interesting slant on it all). The thing is, he was in the neighborhood, got caught up in someone else\\'s drama (even this is doubtful, there was no woman around) and was barred for a single night.

Sorry, but that is reality.So dear reader, the solution is to raise more money so we can spread things out a little, give a little elbow space -- if we took 25 guys out of there we could have room to roll over without knocking noggins.  That must be my goal.  365 nights of shelter @ lets say $150 (being optimistic, allow me please this one indulgence) equals  $54,750 divided by 12 is $4,500 a month.

Before I can respond he asks me if I have ever asked God about aliens controlling humans with microwave energy so that we will fight with each other.  He got up and moved and I pondered the likelihood of alcohol psychosis.As we were leaving (we being Father Kim and I) we were stopped by one honest man -- a Scotch-Irish \"I\"  (Hey, he fits in very well with the list of regulars above!).  Grew up agnostic acknowledged his lost-ness.  His blunt openness was refreshing.  Hope we run into I again.Milk Maid came all the way out to the sidewalk to thank us.  (She was afraid we wouldn\\'t come back after MFQAB reopens -- we started going to her joint looking for MFQAB evacuees two or three months ago.Anyway, from Milk Maid to the yuppiefied but nice MFQAB.  Kind of quiet, hasn\\'t had it\\'s grand reopening yet.  After being empty for three months, it will take time for word to get out.  But it was good to see some regulars, they seemed happy to see us.  The whole place is muted and rich in feel, very different but cool. And NO SMOKING.  On down to Third & Bell.  Place was packed -- first of the month, people have dough in welfare land.  Third Gospel looking natty  in the bar, R#3 playing pool and looking as healthy as I\\'ve ever seen him, sans wheelchair.  \"K\" greeted us warmly as usual, and the Man With No Identity there as usual.  I need another name for him, now that he\\'s got two pieces of picture ID and is soon going to get Social Security.  Hope the room opens for him in our building.We had a deeper conversation than usual -- me trying to fit a wedge between the Catholic priest who got in the worst bar fight he\\'s ever seen, and a living love faith relationship with the Creator.  Every human being is broken and at some level a failure.  This does not negate the fact that God can use them for a good purpose.  We all sin.  But God loves us.  I think MWNI is getting it.  I also took the opportunity to pick at the source of some of his anger with family over money and respect.  He wished me a happy Christmas, but I pointed out I would see him at least three more times before Christmas.Home to Nightwatch -- where there was a quiet night, no turn-aways and no problems.  Off to bed!   Pastor Rick\\n',\n",
       " 'All Creation Groans -- apparently there\\'s something in the wind.  The bartender on Dravus fractured her hand and is out for 4-5 weeks.  So sad.  Father Kim and I thought it was going to be a fruitless visit when a guy at the bar stopped us before we left.  Talking with him we found that he had gone to high school at Queen Anne with one of Kim\\'s sons, and knew Kim\\'s daughter-in-law.  He was shaking his head at the \"small world\" and wondering what it meant.  This soul has never left Queen Anne Hill.We went on to MFQAT -- newly remodeled, lovely spot.  J having wine, looks really great. He\\'s lost 15 pounds, has really cut back on the drinking, is exercizing.  Still smoking, but less.  Not sure of the impact of exercise while smoking.  I encouraged him to keep going.  As I was leaving was again stopped by someone, wanting to know what we do.  He slipped me $40.  This makes $290 in bar donations in a month, which has to be a record.  I haven\\'t gotten even $100  in the previous 20 years of this work.  Weird.It is pouring rain.  My knee is throbbing from what turns out to be a gout attack.  I am as emotionally a wreck as at any time in my life, run down from the Phoenix marathon on Sunday, no doubt.  But by the weekend I have recovered.  God is good.R\\n',\n",

       " 'Reporters are tough to accomodate in this line of work. They want their story, but homeless people don\\'t really want to be reported on. Who does?Tonight I had Chris F. from KIRO Radio in tow. I ditched him. Actually, I thought he might have a more interesting night hanging out in our shelter dispatch center than sitting on a barstool with me and Father Kim. So we left him, and promised to come back at 10:15 and get him to go with us to one of the bars.I was a little sceptical about getting everything done tonight. I had to see a guy downtown, and didn\\'t want to stay out until midnight -- between fighting a cold and trying to get in shape for running a marathon, the late hours have been taking their toll. Anyway.Kim and I had a fairly slow night at Dravus Street. J-Man playing pool, happy milkmaid tending bar. Only tonight she wasn\\'t so happy. A friend of her housemate committed suicide on their front porch. Hung himself, neighbor saw him. Police said he didn\\'t suffer, then they arrested a girlfriend on old warrants or something. So milkmaid was asking for prayer for her friend. Up at MFQAB (My Favorite Queen Anne Bar) -- interesting dichotomy. The regulars at one end, me and two of my buddies at the other, all of us drinking (a.) decaf coffee, (b.) Diet Pepsi, (c.) Pellegrino water. The answer is (d.) all of the above. Across the room is a bunch of soccer moms and a few dads, looking strangely at home in the new digs which MFQAB is now become. \"What\\'s going on?\" Turns out it was the local PTA after-meeting. They decided to check out the \"new\" MFQAB. Soon I was hugging the principal. (We\\'re buddies, friend of friends sort of thing). Pretty funny.Back to Nightwatch, picked up the reporter, back down to 3rd and Bell. Pouring rain still (building an ark not such a bad idea around Seattle lately). Anyway, Reporter Chris and Father Kim got into an extended and fairly interesting conversation with R#3 while I talked with regulars inside. Lots going on -- many deaths and health problems among the regulars, have some of the rest of them spooked. I think it is fairly common after the holidays, and when I think about the health compromises most of the 3rd and Bell folks have -- 2 packs and 12 beers a day can take their toll. Anyway people were feeling a little fragile. Bartender D. gave me info for Rev. Norm (which I finally got to him) and my friend, the MWNI conversed with me about moving into our apartments. Which is another thing. I gave him the application on Thursday night, and I still haven\\'t got it back. Why?The fact that we have a vacancy is rather weird. I told him I thought something would happen. Well, something did. Tenant in 301 died. We discovered him on New Year\\'s Eve, during the day. Age 57. Died in bed. We\\'ll call him MB. I had a conversation with him the day he died -- \"How you doing?\" as he was coming into the building. I held the door for him. \"Just can\\'t throw this thing\" was his answer. Indeed. So sad.Anyway, done with 3rd and Bell, but Reporter Chris and Fr. Kim had spent the whole time out on the sidewalk talking to R#3 who had missed his bus in order to be interviewed.  I knew the whole thing was going to get compressed down to about 30 seconds or less, but I think R#3 felt a little vulnerable -- he\\'s a true talker, but tends (like all of us) to say too much. He needed a ride home so we dropped him off uptown, got back to Nightwatch at a reasonable time (I was afraid it was going to be super late -- so much for worrying.)Pray for me.  Pray for the homeless people in this terrible rain.   Rick\\n',\n",
       " 'A New Year!Most places were very quiet, maybe because of too much partying last night, but there is always someone to talk to. I made stops at only 4 places.Met couple of friends at NO in Pioneer Square. Happy New Year from and for them. Met a frizzy haired red head (named Ja.) we had a good talk about OPNW. She seemed to be impressed. I didn\\'t find out to much about her but she is a friend of T. who hangs out there.Always good contact at K. D. at th bar, he had a good trip to Oregon for Christmas to see family.Greeted a number of regulars and had an interestingt conversation with L.B. about homelessness. Gave him a card for a \"one night pass\" at OPNW Got an e-mail from him the next day saying he had given it to a fellow he knows who is homeless. D. informed me that B. ( an ex-barmaid) had a stroke and is in Harborview. Will try and check in her.Had cup of soup at 2B. but very little contact there tonight.Saw F. at NL as usual and had a good visit.

       " 'Hey, on the street since 1982, and tonight I had my first flat tire.  At the end of the night, on my way back to Nightwatch, I felt the car pulling, pulling.  Finally realized what was going on (\\'hey, it\\'s not the bumpy road after all!\\') and thankfully found a level parking spot.   There was a party on the sidewalk, spilling out from someone\\'s swanky downtown condo.  They commiserated with me (\"The priest has a flat!) and two different women (!) offered to help me out.  Made me feel like a million to have some young thing in party clothes offer to help. heheehee.  Fifteen minutes and I was on my, thank goodness I had everything I needed.But it was a great night -- ran into an old friend up on Broadway.  Larry saved me when I was about 20 -- crash on the freeway, and there was Larry my bud directing traffic around me, helped me limp the car off the freeway.  There\\'s a lot more to the story.  Anyway, nice conversation with him and his fiance.On to MFQAT.  Lots of regulars, lotsa NW love out there -- it has been upscaled so some people miss the tawdriness of the old place.  The new bartender doesn\\'t ignore you or growl, so maybe it\\'s just no fun anymore?  But the three HD wide screens are sure nice for watching ice skaters.  Nice conversations with several patrons, and many more greetings.Then on to the Dravus Street bar.  Wasn\\'t sure I was going to stay long, but it was midnight (bar time) before I got out of there.Milk Maid was back.She\\'s had a tough couple months.   She fell on the job a while ago and fractured her hands or wrists, and had to take many weeks off the job.  She was back for a week, then her aged mother passed away (prayers go out to the extended family).  So this was the first Thursday back.I asked if what bartender V. said was true, that she had worked at this bar for 30 years.  She said yes, off and on.  Amazing.  (Also amazing, that the owner would give her a hard time about applying for L&I from being injured on the job. Unbelievable.)She was really happy to see me (did I mention I was alone tonight?)As I stood at the bar, I looked down and saw a blue Mariners bag, and yep, sure enough there was \"J\" parked there, just like last week.  He still has no place to go, so I called our worker back at the home office.  No more shelter left (it was 11:15 by this time).  I asked \"J\" what he was going to do.  I guess he\\'s been going to a 24 hour restaurant in Ballard and hanging out for the night.  They don\\'t mess with him, which is pretty amazing when you think about it.  It must be a headache for the crew to have a drunk just sitting there for a whole shift.  They must be cool with it or it wouldn\\'t continue.  (Note to Pastor Dave -- does the former barmaid from 3rd and Bell still work at this 24 hour restaurant which we have visited?)Anyway, had a very dynamic conversation with \"J.\"  Encouraged him to get a vision of himself helping others in like circumstances get off the booze and back on their feet.  He\\'s sort of given up because he\\'s been fighting alcohol his whole life, has a few months of sobriety a year ago, but relapsed.  Really praying that he would commit himself to the steps and give himself over to God as he understands him.  He was shedding tears as we talked, but I\\'ve learned not to take the tears of a drunk very seriously.  Still, there was resonance.Thank you to the donors who make the work possible, to the hardest working crew of people in the world:  Ann, Paul, John, Sherry, Theo, Jeff, Billy, Alfred.

       " 'Seattle doesn\\'t usually get this cold.    Operation Nightwatch responded.  Extra blankets went out to three different shelters -- ROOTS shelter http://udsp.org/root and FASC shelter http://www.fasconline.org/default.asp and the temporary cold weather shelter run by Salvation Army on a contract with City of Seattle, located at City Hall, 4th and James.We also had volunteers riding along in two police vans, trying to convince homeless people to go into shelter for the cold weather.Plus Father Kim and I were out and aboutWe stopped by the Seattle Center and made contact with the security people there.  Talked to several homeless guys who were hanging out in the Center House; at 10:00 p.m. they were off to Sacred Heart shelter, so I guess this is the nightly routine.  They were a little freaky about having 2 priests talk to them.  But it was good.At the Dravus Street bar -- which was pretty dead --  we were goofing at the bar that we had blankets if there were any homeless in the house -- thinking of course that there weren\\'t any.  Goes to show ya.  Some clean cut guy at the bar said he had no place to go.  \"You\\'re kidding?\"  Nope.  So we took \"J\" off to FASC and fixed him up with a mat for the night.  \"V\" was subbing in the bar for the Milk Maid, who is off settling her mother\\'s affairs.  Mom lived to be 92 (pretty good genes there!) V wonders if she\\'ll even come back.  I hope so, just so I can say goodbye or something.  I guess the Milk Maid has worked there 30 years.  I\\'m gonna have to check to see if it\\'s really true.  Can\\'t believe it.I felt compelled to return up to My Favorite Queen Anne Bar since I missed last week.  It was pretty busy -- had a few inconsequential how-de-dos.  One guy reminded us that he gave us $20 bucks at Christmas (he must have been drunk, it was actually $40).  Kim joked that we were waiting for him to borrow it back.  But actually he said these profound words:  \"I\\'m blessed.  I live in a house on Queen Anne.  I want to give it back to the community.\"  He apologized for only having $2 on him; the highs and lows tonight.  One a drunk who just can\\'t quit, having to sleep in heap of humanity, the other wanting to make a difference.Stopped briefly at 3rd and Bell, not much going.  R#3 gave us both calendars.  A phone call from our police volunteers told us NOT ENOUGH SHELTER exists on this cold night.  Harumph.  So much for cold weather planning.  We ran blankets to City Hall where it was really over crowded.   But more needs to be done.OK I\\'m exhausted.  Pray for all the shelter workers and Deputy Director Ann and all the others on the front lines, and don\\'t forget the folks with no place to go at night.  \"Foxes have holes, the birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.\"  Jesus was homeless too.G\\'night.

       " 'Seahawk frenzy is building.  First two stops tonight were so uneventful -- other than the fact that the Milk Maid was back at her post, having fallen and being on the injured reserve list for a month.  Welcome back!  The boys at MFQAT tried to talk me into watching the Superbowl with them.  Feels like a loser thing to do, but then the wifey informed me she was going out with \"The Aunties\" and so I\\'m on my own (again) on a Sunday afternoon.  Enough of my travail.  I\\'ll  let you know if I opt for MFQAT for watching Seattle beat up on the Steelers.If the first two stops were uneventful, wasn\\'t prepared for the bombardment at 3rd & Bell.

Met Hispanic \"G\" again -- pretty drunk, asked for prayer; as our conversation progressed he escalated -- angry, suicidal, called me a liar so I quit talking to him -- he really irked me, but we made up before closing.Listening in was \"C\" who works for an  upscale caterer, very unhappy with self-loathing, alcohol remorse, sexual angst.  Gave  him my card, we shall see.  He was loveable to me.  Two guys name \"K.\" One with beret looked to be making a drug connection after leaving the bar -- he was protesting his virtue just a few months ago.  Alcohol is the true gateway drug.  He\\'s smart, political, and out of control, from the looks of things.  The other K works for the bar, swamps the place out, backs up the bartender.  When asked where he was going to watch the game he said \"At the Adult Day Care\" which would make a great name for this place, dontcha think?Just before leaving met \"Catfish\" and looking at him started asking him questions.  We finally figured out who he was, his connection from years ago at Nightwatch.  He\\'s still on the streets 8 years later, showing definite signs of brain damage from drug use.  Paranoia.  He ducked behind a parked car when someone was shooting off fireworks in the neighborhood, I assume in celebration of Lunar New Year and/or the upcoming Seahawks pre-celebration.  This drew a big laugh from the other drug users and hookers close by.\"Missy\" gave me a big hug and toothless smile.  What a wreck of a human being -- you can see she had some potential, but her ruined looks thanks to meth and whatever - told me it was her 38th birthday, which literally took my breath away.  She looks really tough shape.  \"I want to be 28 again. Is that okay?\"  I had to give her the bad news, no going back.  \"YOU HAVE TO SAY YES!\"I went from Missy to see what Father Kim was up to.  \"D\" was telling him about his days at Princeton Divinity School, quoting scripture, testing us,  owning his alcoholism, claiming the Holy Spirit.  I was able to quote along a little bit (I\\'m really lousy at these sort of confrontations, but God does bring things to mind occasionally).  \"We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities. . .\"  There was definitely warfare happening on the sidewalk last night.  I think watching my friend \"K\" score something from one of the low-life dealers, well, it bugs me.  Why a funny witty smart guy starts down that path, I\\'ll never figure it.

I could only run for 10 minutes, retreated to the hotel exercize room.Obviously there are no homeless hanging around here.But the bar culture is amazing -- somehow the drunks hold it together to keep working. Lots of guys do nothing all winter, go back to work in the spring. Seems like there should be work here, but the locals tell me they're getting laid off, a mill is closing.

       " 'Brother Dave & I needed to do a little research in the Pike-Pine neighborhood, so despite the freezing windy weather, we hung outside for most the night.The first homeless guy we met was a hoot. \"Tommy Salami\" he called himself.\"What do you call a cow with no legs?\" he asked. His answer, \"Ground beef.\"It got better. He had a 25 line street poem he recited, another moment I wish I was carrying a recording device. He and \"Candy\" hung out in a doorway. Takes his showers in detox, gets food from Central Lutheran and Covenant Church and used to eat at \"the Wall\" before that was shut down. Has not found his way to First Presbyterian for the public feed yet. He had an empty can of malt liquor, and derided his own lack of self control. But he\\'s not ready to give up yet. He tries to take care of Candy, but the main attraction is more body warmth. We provided blankets and some snack items, pretty weak for the real need.Ran into \"Jewelry Guy\" who tried to get us to pay five bucks for a decorated love bead. He was really smashed, just outside the little neighborhood grocer that sells the fortified stuff. He took the two bucks from Dave, but wasn\\'t happy that we weren\\'t buying his product.Then we ran into a grouch sitting on the sidewalk in the rain. Started cussing us out for offering him a blanket. Not sure what his incoherent stuff meant, but felt sorry for the entire neighborhood. We could walk away, but what if you were trying to sleep? What a mess.Another 1/2 block and met \"Dave\" panhandling smokes. He had just moved into the Wintonia, a low income building a few blocks away. Not really sure why he was hanging out on a cold night, maybe looking for something more than a cig. Since Brother Dave smokes, they had a drag together. There was real amity for a few moments, and he genuinely wanted the conversation.The shop keeper at Belmont and Pike thought the homeless crowd had moved north to Denny/John. But we didn\\'t see much evidence of it.Spoke at length with a junkie at Seattle Central Community College. He was waiting around to sell a banana seat style bike, we suspected to his connection. He complained about the lack of treatment options. He said there were a lot of folks in empty houses near Broadway playfield.  Can\\'t believe there are many empty houses in this gentrified area.On Broadway we ran across a few others, mostly too drunk for conversation or already dead asleep in doorways.  Probably saw about 10 or 12 homeless folks in the area.  The only common thread was access to rot-gut fortified beer/wine or their drug connections.  When asked why they don\\'t go to Pioneer Square, they offered that they didn\\'t like the vibe.  One guy said he didn\\'t want to go to shelter because he can\\'t drink or get rowdy.Upon return, I reminded the Nightwatch staff that there was a whole group of homeless folks who can\\'t get it together to even get to the dispatch center.Also, we checked in at 3rd and Bell (closed early) and Dravus Street bar (slow after the drug raid over the weekend).

They do great work.  At the door Jeff was checking for referrals, making sure people coming in were supposed to be coming in.

Now that it\\'s the 2nd day of Lent she finally caught up with him -- she doddered out to the car and got it out of the glovebox.  He didn\\'t look at it all night, which I found a little amusing.  I was curious, wondering if it was similar to the one she gave me.Talked to J awhile, greeted some others, the one guy, most amazing.  Shoots one handed pool and he shows up at the bar when he isn\\'t working.  Told him I\\'m looking for a pt security guy, but it conflicts with other work, and I think he\\'s not interested.Made bad error of judgement tonight -- there was a pair working on crossword puzzle, and they were stumped.  They shouldn\\'t have left it in front of me, I went through it pretty quickly, didn\\'t completely solve it, but about 75%.  It was conceited of  me and I just pray it didn\\'t leave a bad taste in their mouth.  Have to trust God about my lack of judgement.  I just felt bad as I left, the show-off priest.  At Third and Bell had two good conversations.  One with an Amtrak worker (retired) who knew all my Amtrak friends, and was very excited about it (D.B. was his name, hope I can remember).  Then, as Third Gospel was closing up the bar, this nicely dressed younger man told us how much he appreciated us being in there.  He said he used to come to Nightwatch when he was homeless, how much he appreciated the treatment he received, the food and shelter that he got.  \"If it wasn\\'t for Nightwatch I\\'d probably be dead.\"  He knows he needs to deal with his drinking, but he also knows God loves him and has blessed him and that Christ lives in him.  We thanked him for his encouraging words and encouraged him to live in faith and do the right thing.As we walked back to the car at the end of the night, I told Father Kim that I wished we could have taped the testimony.  It was very moving, and should make everyone associated with this work feel pretty good about it.Thanks to all of your for your prayers, support and hard work on our behalf.Love, Pastor Rick.\\n',\n",

       " 'Tonight I finally figured out who Dogboy is.  He gave me my quote for the night.We were talking about fitness and running:\"I used to run, until I coughed up a cigarette butt and a bottle cap.  Then I quit.\"Dogboy is a frustrated drummer.  His brother the guitarist is with an internationally known rock band (I won\\'t say which one).  Dogboy is funny.After talking to him, I spent the rest of the night in another bar, up on Queen Anne, My Favorite Queen Anne Tavern (MFQAT) .  The reason I use fake names, I don\\'t to get anyone in trouble; if you narrow down the possibilities and figure out the person I\\'m talking about in this thing, then they hire a lawyer and I end up in Sing Sing, black-balled.It was actually several nice quiet conversations at MFQAT.  Nothing rowdy.  Decided to make a semi-early night of it (short changed 3rd & Bell), returned to Operation Nightwatch before midnight, hung out a little (OKAY, I ate an apple fritter, boo hoo), watched the final mop up of homeless people and got to bed.  The deal is, I went to a prayer breakfast, left the house at 6:30 a.m. after getting to bed at 12:45.   Phew.    Rick\\n',\n",

He adds an edge to what I talk about related to homelessness (he's not homeless, but a little obsessive about it -- not sure what his diagnosis is, but suffice to say he's out there).  Plus, he is an extra set of hands for carrying stuff.  He has always been very appropriate too, which is nice.  Maybe I'll see if he wants his pic in the blog sometime.So yesterday we were at a class at Seattle Pacific University (www.spu.edu) and the teacher, very cool -- Delia Nuesch Olver -- interviewed me, and students asked questions, and the 90 minutes flew by.

It wasn\\'t much, just over $200.  \"One of the churches is going to help some.\"Now I thought about it.  This guy is a pretty good guy, kooky, but good hearted.  He wants to help homeless people.

This is the second time in two months R#2 has needed help.  Different reasons every time.  The pastor is not going to walk away however.  They\\'re going to help R#2 with what he really needs -- some protective payee care, along with the check.  The church agreed to help with the full amount.  Wow.

When Ron was 9th grade he started exhibiting signs of schizophrenia. By the time I was in college he was in and out of institutions, often times on the street, or living in a half-way house, or a commune someplace. Then in 1976, he disappeared, never to be seen again in Seattle.For years his absence haunted me. Then one night I had a dream. Ron knocked on my front door and said \"Look! I\\'m fine!\"I took it to mean he was in the presence of God -- and I haven\\'t worried since.But every once in a while I look at some homeless guy at Operation Nightwatch and wonder, what would Ron look like now, on his 53rd birthday?

Walt is one.He was drunk when I met him in line outside Operation Nightwatch (www.seattlenightwatch.org) but he said something no homeless guy had ever said in 20 + years on the street: \"Pastor Rick, I\\'ve determined that never again in my life will I own a lawn mower.\"The next day he stopped by my office, and I invited him to move into our building as a tenant. This led to three months of hell.Now if you have never seen someone toxic from alcohol, it is not a pretty sight. Walt proceeded to get drunk every day, blowing out effluvia from both ends. I found him wandering the halls of the apartment building draped in a towel, covered with BM from his head to his feet. And the smell cannot be described. We determined to clean out his room while he was in the hospital (he gave his drunken permission when the fire department hauled him away.) The load of excrement and carpet/furniture/mattress was so bad I had tears in my eyes tying down the tarp along the side of a windy freeway. Ok, enough grossness.What happened next is also beyond description, a total God thing. Walt fell and broke his back.He went off to Swedish Hospital, spent 30 days in traction and detoxed at the same time. He came back to a different unit in our building, a changed man. That was 6 years ago.I had not heard from Walt in a few months (he had moved from our building into several different great places) and I was getting worried; I called his last housemate and his workplace to see if he was still ok.So last night Father Kim and I started our night on the street with a visit to Walt\\'s place in Ballard.He looked amazing, and his apartment is really stylish. Hard to believe it\\'s the same guy. He\\'s working, keeping really busy with driving for a food bank, volunteering for Homeland Security duties with the Coast Guard Auxilary, an ambassador at the Woodland Park Zoo, and other interests.When I am in a church that recites the Apostle\\'s Creed (http://www.creeds.net/ancient/apostles.htm) and get to \"I believe in . . . the resurrection of the body,\" I always will think of the resurrection of Walt.Once you get a taste of that, you want more!There\\'s so much more I could tell from last night -- first night with two Fuller Seminary students, renewing friendships at My Favorite Queen Anne Bar after my three week layoff, and finally got the name of someone there I\\'ve talked to many times -- I\\'ll call him Minor Prophet.

This may be another good reason to stick together!At MFQAT got to see all the regulars.  J. said he had a dream about me:  \"Father Kim came in alone and told us you had died.\"  It\\'s nice to be missed!Tug Boat seemed a little distant.  Didn\\'t pursue conversation.

One character named Eric was 86\\'d out of the bar and took his frustration out on the windows.  They didn\\'t break, which made him look even more pitifully inept.  Nice to have plexiglas.A young woman sitting near the windows decided to move up to the bar next to me during all the excitement.  She was reading and underlining in a book, so I had to ask.   She was a grad student at a local Catholic university.  In one of the worst bars in town!What an interesting conversation we had -- Catholicism, married priests, women in ministry, foreign languages (she knows five!).  One guy leaned over to me and said something in German, then handed me $100 for the cause.  It was one of the rare times I\\'ve gotten to use my miniscule knowledge of Deutsch.We stayed to closing at midnight, and gave R#3 a ride home.

So they\\'re going to face a firing squad.

Really, we insist, take the blindfold.  \"No thank you.\"  You\\'ve got to take the blindfold.  \"No, no blindfold.\"Finally Sal can\\'t take it any more.  \"Ira, take the blindfold already, why make trouble?\"You had to hear the guy\\'s Jewish accent.

Initially I had typical feelings about it, lots of fear, anxiety, that creepy invaded feeling.What took me by surprise was that I had very little anger -- rather, I found myself wondering about the thief. What was it that drove him to this? How desperate must he have been?After many days of wondering \"What can I do to prevent this?\" and considering home security systems, blockwatch parties, etc, I got a Nightwatch bulletin. Suddenly I had an answer -- it seemed so basic, too easy. . . \"Support people & places that help desperate people!\"I\\'m not saying that the people who come to you are a bunch of thieves -- only that I\\'ve had a taste, now, of what desperation can do to a person, what it can drive them to.Doesn\\'t it make sense to give them a hand? to help keep them from reaching that horrible dark desperate place? I think so.I need to become a better steward for Nightwatch. Thanks for all you do! JBWhat a lift to get a letter like that in the mail. What a great attitude.

       " 'Dravus Street bar was inhabited tonight, though the beer signs that Father Kim and I had turned on are now off again -- someone is undoing our fine work of last week. Milk Maid in the bar, laying down the law on Dogboy, who is hollering \"I need -----\" You, gentle reader, can fill in the rest, related to some arrested development, too much beer, and a fixation on female anatomy.Despite Dogboy we had several interesting and productive conversations: \"M\" and the other \"M\" (sounds like a great name for a chocolate candy that won\\'t melt in your hand) both were nice conversations. M1 is hoping to ship out as a deck hand on a fishing boat this summer, wanted help with his dental device which had broken. Gave him my card - one of the missions has a dental office, not sure if they can handle a partial bridge. He was pretty sloppy, shoved the card in a jacket pocket, bummed some smokes off Pastor Dave (Hey, that ploy works. I\\'m gonna buy a pack of Marlboros for the sake of the gospel). M2 revealed his deep Queen Anne roots -- lost a wife to heroin overdose. Sad. Nice guy, hope to catch up with him some more in the future. Meanwhile Pastor Dave threw a couple games of pool. He had a good conversation. Guy said, \"You guys are changing things in here,\" and Dave replied, \"The Holy Spirit does that.\" M2 also had to acknowledge that God was in the bar tonight. And M1 sloppily told me that Jesus Christ keeps him alive, despite the beer and abuse. As I write this I realize I shoulda asked him \"Why.\" He was starting to get into his Pentecostal rap in a Missouri twang. Pretty charming.On to MFQAT -- had nice chat with Train Guy -- always fun to talk to; \"J\" continues to melt away -- pretty awesome progress. We joked around a bit -- he was explaining something about some church he visited doing things differently than he grew up with, and I said something sarcastic about him being someone who is very particular about the places he hangs out in -- waving my arm around MFQAT. Bit of a dig. The dilemma is that hanging out there you get a sense of community, it\\'s convenient for those in the Queen Anne neighborhood; but it\\'s a pretty narrow range of human activity. I always say I need a crowbar to pry some folks out into the real world -- but that can be intimidating if you\\'re new in town, shy, need the bolstering, whatever. There\\'s got to be some amazing studies of the difference between American bars and British pubs. Oh yeah. The \"other\" bartender tonight is not the Erudite One, but we shall call him \"Red\" and hope to use that cue to remember his real name. And the Grad Student too; maybe a reader will remind me of her real name, so I don\\'t have to keep finessing it.I\\'m missing a couple in this bar who used to stay out later, or maybe I was coming in there earlier.

They\\'ve got spray paint construction marks on the sidewalk. The owner didn\\'t sell this place did he? What would happen if it closed?\"\"It would be. . .\" Milk Maid pauses, wheels turning as she contemplates the closure of this run down seedy place where she has worked for 25 or 30 years. \"It would be. . . great!\" and she smiled sunnily at the prospect.She agreed that her bar was a little ragged. \"Needs lighting,\" she pointed out. But a bunch of the beer signs weren\\'t lit. Father Kim says \"I think we can reach that one,\" and drags a chair behind the bar. Since he\\'s probably 4 inches taller than me, he clambers up on the chair, then up on the back bar, reaches up and jiggles the gaudy neon Budweiser sign, while I flip the switch on the power strip, probably zeroing out the cash register. Suddenly, there was light! (Lite??)So then we notice all the other unlit beer signs. This was our amusing work for the next 20 minutes; we got another one to work, figured out which were burned out or lacked an outlet, found junk thrown up on high shelves by impish patrons. Good deed done, we were off to MFQAT (My Favorite Queen Anne Tavern).Here were 5-6 regulars, also a slow night. \"J\" talked about his continued self-improvements (yes, plural) and spoke hopefully of things to come. I talked briefly with several others -- good guys, all dealing with the usual things. Father Kim spent the entire night talking to one woman (can\\'t remember the name I gave her for these purposes. Tug Boat Annie comes to mind.)Tug Boat is waxing eloquent as only she can -- has the full conjugation of the F word down quite well. She was all het up about immigrants. \"Let the MFers learn Fing English\" which struck me and Father Kim as being hilarious -- plus the phrase \"breeding like rabbits\" was uttered and repeated. But bless her, she\\'s been getting to church with son age 30, and she did buy our water last night, 2 bucks. I left a tip for the erudite bartender.Hope MFQAT is making it.Back at the home office, one woman was waiting for placement. I called in the coordinates for Tent City 3, currently at 22nd and Cherry.

Our problems pale against the obstacles face by our friends on the street.Last night was a little goofy. For one thing, our Board president Tim J. and I were the cooks. He opened cans of beef stew and I whipped up some garlic mashed potatoes (yummy), and we waited for the volunteer servers to show up. Waited and waited. One guy was there at the opening, and one guy walked in after we opened. So President Tim covered the line while Pastor Dave and I hit the bars; Tim would call when he was ready to go.Dave whipped a guy at pool (ok, except for the scratch on the 8 ball) and I had a nice talk with a few Dravus Bar people (email me for name and location). It\\'s a tough bar, lots of little activities going on. Milk Maid in the bar, as nice as always.Just before arriving at MFQAT we got the call to get Tim. On the way back downtown we decided to have me go alone to MFQAT (I dissed them on Monday night and felt bad) and so dropped Tim and Pastor Dave off at 3rd and Bell.At MFQAT found the bartender and 3-4 regulars waiting for me, telling me I was late (it was about 11:00 p.m. by this time). It was fun, nothing very serious, except Minor Prophet (age early 20s) revealed too much MFQAT knowledge and I said something I think he heard: \"You need a different hobby!\" Hope I didn\\'t hurt his feeling, but maybe we have enough history now that he can hear it. It\\'s a matter of prayer -- he\\'s too young to be sitting with a bunch of geezers and isolated from sober people his age.I\\'ll invite him to check us out sometime.Although J has never done it. He continues to melt away amazingly. Congrats.Plus the Erudite One behind the bar continues to amaze me. A few words were said about Russian authors and one sentence of plot, comes up with Kafka \"The Trial.\"If there ever was Team Jeopardy, Bar League, I do believe that MFQAT would clean up.I jumped off the stool remembering my companions downtown; here I found Pastor Dave praying fervently at the bar with a woman in crisis, Tim talking to a guy with a cast on his leg, the bar stools up, and final final call. Gilbert was drunk and onery. I\\'m done with him after his performance last week. Told me he was going to commit suicide (not serious) -- told him that would make everyone sad. Wants to know how to be happy, told him to quit drinking. But I\\'m not going to engage with him if I can help it. He\\'s crude and irrational when he\\'s drunk.Texas Dave wants to go to Nawlins and help Katrina victims, wants me to figure it out for him, told him to call today. We shall see.Anyway, I was happy that Pastor Dave was especially useful in being the presence of Christ tonight -- don\\'t know what good I did, but seeing him seriously counseling someone did me a world of good. Thank you Dave!Rick\\n',\n",

Proof that there was confusion all around -- they were standing on the sidewalk outside of Nightwatch.  Just standing there.  Ann discovered them almost by accident.  They didn\\'t know there was a door bell to ring.  So they didn\\'t tell me they were coming, they just showed up, they didn\\'t ring the bell to the office -- a button clearly marked \"OFFICE\" right by the door.What to do?  It\\'s 11:15 now, I\\'m calling back everyone I tried in the morning -- the Tigrinian community center, World Relief local office, the Family & Adult Service Center.  There the worker said they take walk-in interviews at 11:30.  She didn\\'t sound hopeful though.I asked them if they were hungry -- whipped up a batch of scrambled eggs, had some pastries (what a shock, Nightwatch with pastries on the premisses), whole milk (not past the pull date either) and some peanut butter and bread.I realize they\\'ve only been in the USA since late February.  Maybe peanut butter wasn\\'t such a good idea.  The eggs they ate using fingers until I realized it wasn\\'t a cultural thing, but I forgot to give them sporks.  My bad.Then we cleaned up and hustled down to the Family & Adult Service Center on Third Ave. between Virginia and Lenora.Walked in, and were still very graciously received, even with tons of confusion.  The kids were ready to play with the toys they saw; we were hustled off to Kimberly J.\\'s office, where Pastor Rick and the two kids had English classes and recess (bouncing a balloon back and forth to each other).  Kimberly dialed a phone number of a translator provided by the husband, nick-named \"Z\" by me today since his Eritrean name was six unpronounceable syllables, starting with a Z.  The wife, Mulu, has an easier name.  It took an hour on the nose to talk back and forth about expectations in two languages (it could have been more confusing; FASC had an Arabic speaking person on the premisses and Z speaks a little Arabic).  At the end of the interview Kimberly pronounced them fit for their program, and the happy family moved in -- two carry-on size bags, in a room with two sets of bunk beds.  Teeny-tiny, but just exactly what was needed.Thank you:  World Vision, Family & Adult Service Center, Neighborhood House (for the translating service), Operation Nightwatch donors & staff, Fuller Seminary students Joe & On, plus all the various do-gooders that got this family this far along.

(They had fun putting on clerical collars for the first time.)But there were three families at the Operation Nightwatch dispatch center, waiting for help. One of those three homeless families was out of options.Mom, Dad, a four year old boy and 2 year old girl. They speak no English. They have been in the United States for 7 weeks. Not sure about their immigration status.We tried to sneak them into Tent City 3, but the residents didn\\'t want to take the risk of having children in the camp. I agree it wasn\\'t a good option, but better than nothing, which is what we were dealing with.So, I ended up taking them to the Marco Polo -- a reasonable hotel on Aurora Avenue. The manager was very helpful, and one of the students paid for the room -- like $65Don\\'t know what will happen with them after this one night -- hopefully I\\'ll be able to get them in someplace tonight for a month or two.Monday nights in the bar, what a snore!Sorry Pastor Norm. It is too quiet for me on a Monday night.After getting the family settled, we ended up going to the bars, in reverse order. Third and Bell had the best conversations, the two students connected with some patrons, I met a new guy talking with the former Man with No Identity (MWNI) who now is a tenant at Nightwatch. We agreed that this would be a good setup for \"Eugene\" (city, not his name), so he may pop by for an application, though we have no openings.On to My Favorite Queen Anne Tavern (MFQAT). Really dead -- sort of dissed the bar, sorry guys. Hope no one took offense, walked in, walked out. Spent a few minutes with Minor Prophet out on the sidewalk. He had a great day, set some sort of selling record at his store, so hoorah for him.Then Dravus Street -- exact opposite order. Had \"interesting\" conversation with two women, both pretty smashed. Not sure if I was solicitated or not -- one was way too pretty to be working (despite Hollywood, hookers are usually more disturbing than attractive). I hope I was more unsettling to her than she was to me.The students played pool, and at 11:30 we called it quits for the night. Up for a Board Meeting, reporting back at 7:00 a.m. YIKES!

       " 'Hey, not what you think.We don\\'t have enough shelter for anyone in town, but we don\\'t have enough shelter for women in Seattle. We had some nights in April when we turned away 7 - 9 women. All the women\\'s shelters were full. (Actually SHARE/WHEEL may have had space available, but they don\\'t take one-night referrals from us -- too disruptive for their \"self-managed\" model, and too difficult to take women in to their system in the late hours. grrr)Also, there probably is more space if the existing shelters would agreet to take more -- some of them place limits because their host organizations limit them, sometimes their lack of creative problem solving is another limiting factor. Anyway, enough grousing.The women of Nightwatch pose special problems. If they are here, they are more likely to have been \"barred\" from other programs because of bad behavior; drug/alcohol/mental illness or some combination may be a factor. Being \"barred\" means you can\\'t access those programs any longer, or have to go through an appeals process. A bar can last one night, a week or month, or, for more serious offences, can be permanent. When a guest threatens a staff person, volunteer, or another guest, we tend to take such threats of violence pretty seriously.So, we\\'re currently checking on possiblities for Nightwatch to take on the task of serving these women -- small scale part-time shelter -- a dozen women, two staff people overnight, up and out by 7:00 a.m. location, staffing, and whether we can really make it happen to be determined.Praying for wisdom and resources.Rick\\n',\n",

I worked two nights as the shelter dispatcher at 14th and Main, which meant shipping homeless people off for shelter.On Tuesday night, about 15 minutes before the hordes descended, some social worker showed up with a mom who spoke no English, and six little kids.  I grabbed the SWer and told him he couldn't dump his people off anymore -- he had to take the family to the hotel.  He wanted a letter to prove that they were homeless too, which was a pain.  Anyway, he stuck around while I registered the family, then they left.  About twenty minutes later I got a call, right in the middle of the crush of people -- another family, could they come for help?  I told them no.  They need to be on time (formerly no later than 8:30).  Anyway, a second social worker appeared to tell me she had another family in the car.  I turned her away too (I suspect it was the same lady).What the heck is going on?  I think they are using our voucher system to establish homelessness for the families, then going to social and health services to get aid and transitional housing; none of these families look like they are in distress, no luggage or belongings, not even anxious about anything.  We are all suspicious.Besides, this is not a safe environment for kids.  Bringing in 6 - 10  kids into a room full of unscreened single adult homeless men is not good.

Invariably someone will catch me in my ignorance (I\\'m pretty out there about it, actually) and give me the old \"You call yourself a minister and you don\\'t even know about the Knights of Pythias\" routine.Social worker Joe Martin at Pike Market Medical Clinic is a great advocate for homeless people.Downtown was pretty wacked, this being the first of the month and some people had too much money, lots of action on the street.

Gave DaNang and friend a ride back to his place, finally getting the drunk to leave us alone. Not sure what he was angling for -- but we weren\\'t going to give him money, gave him advise about finding shelter for the night -- DESC is pretty vacant tonight.

       " 'Low LifeLures and Snares of Old New York, by Luc SantePublished by Farrar, Straus and Giroux, New York, 1991“Night”At night sometimes in certain parts of the city, usually in those remaining streets that are left deserted, usually in winter, but sometimes in other seasons if the streets are sufficiently forsaken, the past can be seen as if through a smeared window. Sometimes this effect occurs only for an instant: when you’re walking back from someplace with a head crammed with company and music and sensations, to a point where all new sensations dissipate, on some dead street in the middle West Side lined with jobbers and import showrooms and loading docks and shuttered luncheonettes, or on a street on the Lower East Side where the intersections have no stoplights and everything is nailed down and dark and the only people to be seen dart by as furtively as wraiths. There will be no traffic, and the streetlights will seem to shrink back into their globes, drawing their skirts of illumination into tight circles, and the rutted streets reveal the cobbles under a thin membrane of asphalt, and the buildings all around are masses of unpointed blackened brick or cacophonies of terra-cotta bric-a-brac or yawning cast-iron gravestones six or eight stories tall. This is the sepulcher of New York, the city as a living ruin.It is also the bridge to the past, the past that shares the same night as the present, even if it inhabits a different day. The night is the corridor of history, not the history of famous people or great events, but that of the marginal, the ignored, the suppressed, the unacknowledged; the history of vice, of error, of confusion, of fear, of want; the history of intoxication, of vainglory, of delusion, of dissipation, of delirium. It strips off the city’s veneer of progress and modernity and civilization and reveals the wilderness. . . . In the streets at night, everything kept hidden comes forth, everyone is subject to the rules of chance, everyone is potentially both murderer and victim, everyone is afraid, just as anyone who sets his or her mind to it can inspire fear in others. At night, everyone is naked. (p. 357-358)Thought it applied to Nightwatch! Rick\\n',\n",

Could be a familiar spirit, don’t know.  But also told me he is evil.  Is thinking about Jesus, because he’s in love with someone he works with – a restaurant in Wallingford neighborhood.  She wanted to know if he was religious, wanted to know what he thought of Jesus.  How about that.  Maybe God is moving.  Also talked about his lack of forgiveness. Lord, in your mercy, hear me.

Happily it seems that it has not lost it's soul, despite being sold and upgraded by the new owner Christian. The regulars feel comfy, and the younger-upwardly mobile are hanging out in numbers.Anyway, tough Hjelmer melted a bit with Father Kim & I -- showing us pics of his family graves in Norway, having us pray for his young nephews as they took first communion or were confirmed in the Lutheran church. He gave us all something to talk about -- not the greatest businessman in the world, but I do admire his moxie at taking a stab at it. Our prayers go out -- for God's mercy, comfort to the family, and smooth seas ahead. He will be remembered.\\n\",\n",

       " 'http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/blogs/dailyweekly/#entry-745Pint-sized HeroPosted today at 9:22 am by Rick AndersonIt was a packed Rainier Room at Seattle Center yesterday that honored Joe Martin, 55, the Boston-Irish social worker and Pike Market Clinic co-founder. He was named Operation Nightwatch\\'s 2006 Hero of the Homeless as relentless advocate for the poor and powerless. Two years ago, the Low Income Housing Institute similarly honored him, naming one of its Georgetown renovation develpments Martin Court. What does he do to deserve the accolades? His job. The other day, before we could go have a pint at Kells down the alley from the clinic, I waited as Joe checked his messages and found a scary plea from a man who was about to lose his home and was on the verge of suicide. In five minutes, Joe turned it around - calming the man with a social worker\\'s grace, determing he couldn\\'t legally be tossed into the street, and making an appointment to meet him and resolve the problem in the morning. Just another typical few minutes in Joe\\'s 29 years of service to humanity. Among his crusades: dental care for the poor. Too many of his people, he pointedly says, \"when they bite into a sandwich, they leave a tooth in it.\" He rails against wars and conservatives and plays the harmonica or bangs the bodrum for the Clay Pipe band. He also dilligently pursues a modest life: \"If you want to know what God thinks of money, just look at who he gives it to,\" he says. Martin recevied a memorable pre-St. Paddy\\'s Day write-up in the Times this year, in which Rebecca Teagarden described him thusly: \"At 5 feet tall, with rosy cheeks, sparkly blue eyes, wiry beard and tweed cap herding wild Irish hair, he looks the part of an honest-to-God leprechaun. There could not be a better one. Ornery, crafty, gentle, kind, long on wit and loud of song, he belts out a ballad and charms a crowd all for a frothy pint and a bit o\\' coin.\" To which his friends add: \"May you be in heaven a half-hour before the devil knows you\\'re dead.\" (See Ben Benschneider\\'s honest-to-God leprechaun here).

All these human beings who have been inside now have no place to go.I decided to work at the dispatch center last night, calming nerves, providing what little advice and support I could to the army of homeless people looking for help.At 9:15 I drove a woman with a broken ankle, struggling along with a walker, up to the shelter at a local church.

       " 'During the icy weather Operation Nightwatch volunteers have been working with Seattle Police to help get homeless people off the street and into shelter. The following extended report comes from one of those volunteers:Our van (2 cops and me -- the cops both working overtime after their regular shift) must have had conversations with 30 or 40 individuals between 9PM and 1AM. Whenever any of us saw any mass of blankets that we thought might have a person sleeping in it or whenever we saw any person we judged might be homeless, we just stopped the van, I jumped out, and usually one of the officers did too. I\\'d start with a simple question like \"We just want to make sure everyone\\'s got a warm place to sleep tonight. Do you?\" And from that starting point, we might end up with someone who willingly accepted a ride to shelter [they were taking people to the Rainier Room at the Seattle Center, ed]. Or they might have been on their way to a shelter themselves (e.g. several older guys were headed to William Booth). Or they might have required a real sales job by me and the cops to come with us. Or they might have been so apprehensive of the Police van that they just couldn\\'t bring themselves to get in -- the saddest contact I had was with an obviously schizophrenic guy, with just a light jacket on, fluids streaming from his nose, but you could see that he was so wracked by the image of willingly getting into a police car that he just couldn\\'t do it. I tried everything I could to convince him -- five times I had him to the van\\'s door, five times he started waving his arms and saying \"No, man, it\\'s OK. Really. I\\'m OK.\" Finally I just felt like I couldn\\'t get him in without something horrible happening to him or his pride, and now I can only hope that he found some kind of shelter last night.I was impressed by how many of the folks the cops knew by name. Hookers, drug dealers, mentally ill guys, these cops know their territory and have an impressive, no-nonsense relationship with the people.As with all experiences like this, the results were mixed. I am convinced that the three people we found sleeping on a bench in Pioneer square . . . could easily have died had we not come along when we did. They were far too drunk to even comprehend how cold they were until they thawed off in the van. I can feel good that the 10 or so people we took to the shelter traded their freezing journey for a warm mat (and a good crew from Salvation Army running things). I also know that every single person we talked to, even if they refused shelter, appreciated that the cops and volunteers cared about them. Still, I couldn\\'t help marveling at people like a 60-year-old guy shuffling around Pioneer square in -- I am not making this up -- slippers!, insisting to me, over and over, that he was \"OK\".

Their motto \"It beats an alley.\"  Homeless guys kept an eye on things, sort of.

Olive St. on Capitol Hill.This house was owned by Advent Christian Church, and they let young adults live there.  All we had to do was pay all the bills and upkeep.  It amounted to about $30 a month per person, as I recall.  Without that help, I wouldn\\'t have made it through grad school.  The house was sold in the early 1990s to Seattle Housing Resources Group, who tore it down (before it could burn down!) to build low-income transitional housing for families.   http://www.hrg.org/htm/development/dev-projects.htmEmma Pardee was a single woman who ran a boarding house on the site for many years, starting in the late 30s.  She housed people cheap, plus put out a pretty good meal for other people living in neighborhood (people often didn\\'t have a kitchen in their room in those days.)  Her \"boys\" could count on a hearty breakfast, and lunches to go.  One of her guys was Fred S. who\\'s future wife Katie was Miss Pardee\\'s helper. When Pardee (as she was called) became infirm, Fred & Katie moved her in with them.  She died and left the run-down house to the church.  The people who lived there after that point is pretty long:  Loren, Andy, Mary, Kathy, Rick, Lorri, Tim, Ken, Dan, Denise, Quincy, Ralph, Laura, Rachel, Soudamone, Nith, Samphone, Phong Sack, John Mark, Sherwin, Paul, Alan, Sharon, and probably 10 more that aren\\'t coming immediately to mind.

Something like 400 volunteers in the middle of the night wanting to do something about homelessness.All that energy.  Too bad it wasn\\'t the happiest result.  Homeless numbers are up.From the press release:\"Over 125 teams, deployed from nine area headquarters, found a total of 2631 people trying to survive without housing or shelter throughout King County.  This number is 15% more than the total number of people counted in the same areas last year.

       " \"It's not very blog-i-licious:Comments on the proposed Administrative Rules Re: Unauthorized EncampmentsBy Rev. Rick Reynolds, Executive Director, Operation NightwatchOperation Nightwatch serves 140 to 160 homeless individuals every night of the year. Often there are no shelter beds available for the people who come seeking help. For more than 20 years Operation Nightwatch simply assisted homeless people with accessing shelter. But circumstances have forced us to use private donations to expand the existing shelter system through contracting with third party providers, adding to the number of shelter beds available each night in Seattle.Despite adding 75 mats for men (Compass Center at FASC), 25 sober mats for men (Bread of Life Mission) and 30 mats for women (Salvation Army, at Seattle First Covenant Church), Nightwatch continues to turn homeless people away from shelter between 9:00 pm and midnight. On January 10, 2008, after the proposed rules were issued by the City, eleven men were turned away because no shelter was available, on a night when the severe weather shelters were open and also full.Our interest in these administrative rules goes beyond the definitions, processes, and prohibitions that outline civil behavior for city workers, city government, and homeless people themselves. We find nothing in these regulations that outline what IS allowable for people who find themselves with no housing or shelter for a night. May they sleep on the sidewalk? Can they bundle up at a bus stop? What advice can we give to those simply trying to survive tonight outside?These issues must be addressed. The city currently funds severe weather shelters at the Frye Apartments, City Hall, and in extremely harsh weather, at the Seattle Center. These are night-to-night shelters, serving 100 to 200 people. How does the City advise these people on the nights those shelters are not open? What guidance does the City give its shelter contractors? What guidance can the City give other privately funded organizations like Operation Nightwatch, Union Gospel Mission, Bread of Life Mission, CityTeam Ministries, and other shelters turning people away every night?Operation Nightwatch applauds the efforts to end homelessness. Can’t we figure out short term and intermediate steps for people who are homeless now? At midnight tonight we can’t tell some homeless day-laborer that affordable housing is coming in 2011.Rick ReynoldsLabels: homeless Seattle Nightwatch\\n\",\n",

The block of the Millionair Club was deserted.  First Avenue was quiet except for the required intense conversation between a 27 year old office worker and her next boyfriend as they had a smoke outside the organic restaurant.I stood in the alley where so many homeless guys have pissed, and told my impressionable companions this story.Mid afternoon, on a hot day in the summer.   I come into the alley to dump the trash.  Some guy is sleeping right in the middle of the alley, totally exposed to the sun and God and the garbage trucks that rumbled by constantly.I lean over him.  \"Hey, buddy!

I was out late with a group of college students visiting from Greenville, Illinois, a village about 90 minutes from St. Louis, out in the cornfields.   We walked a bit downtown, and saw several weird things, to me: First, there were no people sleeping under Yesler street at 4th Avenue.  This has been a homeless camping area for 20 years.   Second, there was not a single soul in City Hall Park at 8:30 at night.   Third, there was a chaotic queue of homeless people along the Jefferson Street side of the King County Administrative Building, waiting for the opening of the County-funded winter shelter for men run by Salvation Army.  Why they think lining up, first come/first served is a good idea, I don't know. We walked up 4th Avenue.  Across the street homeless people waited for the opening of the severe weather shelter at City Hall (Behind the Red Wall -- sounds like a great book title).   It was 9:00 p.m.  The doors were still locked.    Cold sleet and wind.  But maybe not cold enough?   City of Seattle workers didn't think so. I think any night that the severe weather shelters are closed, the following day they should shut off the heat in all City offices.  It's only fair. It was a miserable night watching homeless people milling around with no place to go.Labels: homeless Seattle Nightwatch\\n\",\n",

And if there is a big awful snowstorm, they add capacity at the Seattle Center.The point -- keep people from dying outside.My beef: People leave in the morning have no idea if the shelter will be open that next night.

Don't worry if they're miserable (as long as we don't have to look at them in their misery).Here are some of my proposals:If the city can't afford basic humane comforts for homeless people in April and May, the city can't afford to heat city offices either.   Use the savings for survival.If Queen Anne residents don't like homeless people in the greenbelts, let there be a LID assessment and use the money to ship the folks who are upset back to Hunt's Point.Open up the Seattle Center for 24 hour shelter.

       " \"Got the following email from Ann, Deputy Director, from Sunday night, April 13:Okay. Total was over 180. 45 women. It was too hard. It was discouraging. It was too hard. It was too hard.  A morbidly obese woman came in from WRC with a walker, and several bags that she could not carry. I think other women from WRC helped her get to us, but then bailed. When I signed her in, she rambled on about having been discharged from Virginia Mason, been treated for edema (she was large but also swollen). She claimed she could not go to another place (she thought our location was the shelter); she just couldn't move anymore. I got her the last spot at Tonya's Room Shelter but she refused to go. She refused to go to any shelter. I offered to call for an ambulance to take her back to the hospital, which she ultimately did.  In the meantime, a male client parked himself near the door. He had come from the hospital too. He too could not move well. When the obese woman and another woman in a wheelchair (she went to Tonya's) came rolling through the door, this man who could barely walk stood up feebly and offered his chair. The women find other chairs with help from more able-bodied clients and the lame man sits back down. At the end of the night, he is one of the 6 male turnaways. Everyone leaves except him. He's the only one left, so he asked if he could stay in the Dispatch Center. He sounded like he wanted to go back to a hospital, but when he talked to the medics on the phone, he told them he would take a cab. Then he changes his mind and told us he would walk out of here and go catch a bus to get to a 174 to ride all night. But he didn't know where the bus stop was, and could not really walk (he has MS). Salvador fetched the pair of crutches we have in the back and the guy leaves, very slowly, very wobbley with the crutches headed for Jackson. I put my head down and pray. Its too hard.  Fifteen minutes later, we close at midnight. Salvador, Paul and I go out the door together and we see the guy with the crutches going down 14th toward Jackson, but he's barely in front of {the neighbor's} place. Its been fifteen minutes. I can't stand seeing it, so I go fast around the corner to my car, which is parked on Main, in front of the Temple. I drive up Main, right on 16th to Jackson and right on Jackson, heading home. When I stop at the light on Rainier and Jackson, I see the guy. He's now almost to the corner. And I see a BMW make a u-turn on 14th to pull up right next to the guy. Its Salvador, who gets out and goes to talk to the guy. Salvador clears out his front seat and even demonstrates to the guy how he should back into the seat. The light changed before I saw the guy get in Salvador's car, but I'm sure he gave him a ride. Thank God for Salvador. This is too hard. Just another crappy April night at Operation Nightwatch.

He decided that rather than being homeless, he would build a house under the interstate, using straw. And so he did. He picked up day labor jobs on construction sites. He ruined his clothing about once a week, which made him look and feel pretty lousy. But he was surviving until he could find a friend to split rent with.But the Department of Transportation workers were busy getting ready for future roadway repairs, and mowed the house down. Thankfully, the first little pig was at the community college working on his GED when his house was mown. When he returned home later that night he was pretty freaked out. “Two steps forward, one step back,” he thought, his teeth chattering as he climbed into a dumpster behind an apartment building for the night.The second little pig had a brain chemistry issue that left him depressed. He worked part time for a big-box store, in the electrical department. The pay wasn’t that good, and because he was only part time, there was no health care benefit, which might have been useful in treating his depression.He couldn’t afford a place of his own, so he took pallets that were left here and there around the city, and built himself a small house in the corner of a park, behind some bushes. He showered at a public pool, and picked up his mail at a friend’s house. No one knew he was homeless.The third little pig got some help from his wealthy parents, who put him through school. This pig made a bundle flipping houses when things were going gangbusters, and ended up in a brick house with a view of the lake.One day the third little pig was walking through the park near his house. He saw the little house built of pallets, and made a phone call.The wolf was happy to help. He got the parks department crew to come out and haul away the little pig’s home. It was terribly upsetting to the already depressed pig.

       " 'Posted yesterday at 6:12 pm by Aimee CurlTime is running out for the residents of SHARE Safe Haven. After three years of living in the federal INS building in SoDo (above), they were kicked out last month— an unfortunate consequence of the sprawling 77,000-square-foot space being purchased by a group of Seattle developers and investors last spring. Safe Haven\\'s 30 homeless men and women were able to find temporary space at St. James Cathedral on First Hill, but their arrangement for sleeping there ends Aug. 25th. Unless somebody steps up, they\\'ll be on the street in less than a month.The shelter is a nighttime, emergency-only operation that\\'s been able to find space in and around Pioneer Square for 14 years. The group is self-managed. Walk-ins are not admitted. Occupants are screened at a separate location and organizers ensure that they arrive no earlier than 7 p.m. and disperse before 8 a.m. each day. Sobriety is required. No daytime loitering is allowed. Safe Haven residents have spent months writing letters to everyone from city, county and port officials, to property owners like Qwest Field and Harborview Medical Center. Either they\\'ve received no response, or they\\'ve simply been told \"No.\"\"Unfortunately, I must tell you that there is no county property that can meet your needs at this time,\" King County Executive Ron Sims said in a letter dated July 7. And Alan Painter, interim director of Seattle\\'s Human Services Department, encouraged Safe Haven residents to keep their search \"as broad as possible, including alternatives outside City property and in other neighborhoods,\" before reminding them that \"annually the City of Seattle spends more than $40 million to fight homelessness\"— and that the mayor\\'s Ten-Year Plan to end Homelessness is making progress. Really?The people who depend on Safe Haven aren\\'t giving up hope yet. Though it may take 30 more people sleeping under the interstate— and not carefully crafted letters— to get this town\\'s attention. Thank you Aimee, for helping get the word out about yet another crisis. If there was a fire and thirty middle class people were displaced, the whole community would respond with resources. But this \"disaster\" caused by short sighted public officials, greed, and lethargy, is generating a collective yawn so far. \"Just more homeless people displaced, oh well.\" Why can\\'t the government entity selling this property require that accomodations for 30 homeless people be worked into the development plan?Labels: homeless seattle safe haven INS nightwatch\\n',\n",

People weren't sure what it was going to mean having Nightwatch in the their neighborhood.  Were the old people going to be bothered?  Were residents going to have petty crime?  Were property values going to drop?  Were neighborhood businesses going to suffer?  All of these things were in mind. They gave me 30 minutes to make my case.

I couldn’t believe it.  They got cake!   And I knew I was going to be okay.  Now I have my own place.  But I’ll never forget – they had cake.”  His face glowed as he remembered the moment. The tension in the room evaporated.  People laughed at the way he said it.  Such a big deal.  But for him, the surest sign that God was watching out for him in his darkest hour was this sign of abundance -- a piece of cake, lovingly served up by a Nightwatch volunteer. So.  This morning at Bryn Mawr United Methodist, I told this story, which I don't think I've ever told anyone before.  The gospel lesson:  Jesus feeds the 5,000.

I've spent a night in a snow cave at Source Lake in February. I've spent a week camped on 10 feet of snow in the Necklace Valley, North Cascades. I've stood on the frozen banks of the Stillaguamish River fishing for steelhead in December. But the coldest cold I've ever experienced was one night last year in downtown Seattle, a fine mist falling, 38 degrees, and an army of homeless guys lined up across the street from City Hall, in the vain hope that they would have a place to go for the night. City Hall was closed for shelter that night, because the nightly hardship of being homeless did not yet reach the threshhold of misery that the city deems worthy of a response. Budget pressure you know. Yet I have no doubt that the workers in City Hall are not having to wear thermals or knit hats to get their work done, like the admin staff of Operation Nightwatch. God forbid they should turn off the heat when it's only 38 degrees outside.

I'd round up a pair of homeless guys, send them out, coordinating the areas with the police department, and type up a two page report for someone in the City of Seattle.  The whole deal cost about $300, not counting my time. I got this brainstorm - using volunteers to do the count, and do it all in one night.  That was 1996.  We had 12 volunteers that first year, and we covered all of downtown Seattle starting at midnight.  Everyone agreed, it was too early. The next year we lined the count up with the Seattle King County Coalition on Homelessness Shelter Survey, to get a snapshot of who is homeless in King County. We were discovered by local media, the number of volunteers mushroomed, the area of the count grew. The great thing that we fell into was hosting a breakfast after we were done counting.  Counters took over a local cafe, I chalked the whole expense up to PR, and the elected officials jumped on the band wagon.  I think they've all taken a turn at counting at some point.Last year was amazing, as people all over King County are involved in this tremendous coordinated effort.  For more news on the count, click here.Last year we found 2,631 homeless people.  What about this year?  Tonight at 2:00 am the fun begins.Labels: homeless count Seattle\\n\",\n",

Herchel wanted me to thank them for helping him, many years ago. For years, Herchel faithfully helped Operation Nightwatch in ways not noticed by many people.  He was our gatekeeper; passing out numbered tickets so homeless guys didn\\'t have to stand in line; mopped the floor; and later, when he moved into our apartment building, he picked up litter in the neighborhood, to keep us good with neighbors.Herchel was a man of few words.  He could barely read or write.  He\\'d get excited and tell me things like \"Saw a \\'57 Chevy.\"  When he had a problem, and I couldn\\'t understand him he would get mad.  \"F-ing B-S-\" he would say, clear as a bell.But despite the occasional blue language, he was a man at peace with the world.  He knew his terminal disease could mean a miserable end.  But his faith was an inspiration to me - and still is.  Not very conventional, not churchy, but solid, real, meaningful, gritty stuff.So, I am on vacation this week, traveling from Albuquerque to Denver.

I had in mind to run across the Ballard Bridge, to Nickerson, Westlake, Denny Way, and home. Maybe 13-14 miles.But there was one Little Problem. I hadn’t really finished preparing my sermon for the next day. Acute mental functioning wasn’t going to happen after a 14 mile run. Happily, I recognized the error of my ways, and turned around, headed home.That turn-around gave me something to think about.In Hebrew, שוב . Usually translated repent, the word shub literally means to turn around.It’s easy for me to run the wrong direction, or simply run too far ahead. If I’m paying attention, I stop and turn around.

We want to only build safe housing, so we make housing so expensive that poor people, even working poor people, cannot afford to live inside.Then, when a social conscious developer finds a \"work around\" (one guy in Seattle called it a \"code-hack\") then the neighborhood starts to whine. We don\\'t want tents, we don\\'t want affordable housing (check out Magnolia\\'s NIMBY population), we don\\'t want want subsidized housing close by. Heck, the only poor people we want are the ones who mow our lawns, bag our groceries, serve up our coffee, or flip our burgers.

I was also doubtful that he was one of \"ours.\" See, most of the homeless people we serve are intent on getting to shelter downtown. They don\\'t hang out in the neighborhood during the day. If we see them, we warn them and then we send them away - barring them from receiving services from us. But I was wrong. He was a Nightwatch patron.Please forgive me.One of our workers had already confronted him that night. He was at the bus stop and told us he was waiting for the bus. After your call, we went back to the bus stop - security and supervisor. They told the offender he was barred. So he no longer belongs to us.He\\'s profoundly mentally ill. We had problems in the past, getting him off the streets for the night. He didn\\'t understand the most basic information. His mental illness is complicated by language and cultural barriers.

       " 'Ok, it’s not the first time I’ve jumped in on this debate, but here goes.Tent City 3 should be able to go to any church that will have it.Ninety-nine point nine nine nine percent of the opposition is built on fear and nonsense.  I would – and have – worked, lived near,  and spend time in Tent City.  Almost weekly. I was there when the tents were first laid out in a grassy meadow close to downtown.  I have followed them to nearly every stop they’ve made along the way.   (I hesitate to say EVERY, just in case I’m forgetting something!) Here’s what I say. In a community where homeless people are forced to live outside because we don’t pay them enough to live, because we have a broken social service net, where health care is for the wealthy, and social security doesn’t pay for basic housing, we have to make some allowances.  Some neighborhoods think they should be immune from homeless people.  But those neighbors aren’t being neighbors at all. Fear and hysteria have been used in the past in Maple Leaf neighborhood.  As late as 1940 this language was found in deeds for houses sold in Maple Leaf:“No person of any race other than the Caucasian race shall use or occupy any building or any lot, except that this covenant shall not prevent occupancy by domestic servants of a different race domiciled with an owner or tenant.”  htp://depts.washington.edu/civilr/database.htmWhy would someone want to do that?  They were afraid.  It would damage their neighborhood, put their children at harm, be unsightly, cause distress to the weak and vulnerable, lead to crime.  All the same bogus arguments being kicked around today.And to all those churches who have confused ministry with the business of providing expensive day care to middle and upper middle class families – are you running the day care, or is the day care running you?  Just curious.  You’re letting business and commerce make your decision for you.  What good is that sort of faith?And would the people name-dropping Nightwatch at public meetings knock it off?  Tent City provides a critical need to this city that we need.  Desperately.  So there.Labels: tent city seattle homeless nightwatch\\n',\n",

Except one guy.  Everyone is watching him, as he paces back and forth in the parking strip, disconnected from people and reality.Just about everything about the guy is off.  He looks like he gave himself a haircut in a dark room.  His stream of consciousness jabber is barely recognizable as English.  He is restlessly running his hands up under his shirt as he paces.There were a few muttered comments in line.  “Whack job.”  The entire line of homeless people looked at him warily.“Here’s someone I need to talk to,” I thought to myself. I positioned myself in front of the pacer, so he had to stop.  “I’m Rick,” I said, sticking out my hand.Egad.  His hand was huge, beefy, muscular.  Somehow, in and through the stream-of-consciousness jabber, a conversation took place.  He quieted down.  The pacing slowed, stopped.  The jabber morphed into stories, of working in Alaska, and living with a son, but not any more. In fact, I’m told, no shelter in town will let him stay any longer.  The conversation ends abruptly.  He wanders off into the uncertain night.  It may be easy for you to shrug.  \"What concern is it of mine?\"   Sometimes turning away from a problem is as brutal as bludgeoning a younger brother to death.

This Seattle Housing Authority project was the first integrated public housing project in the country in 1941, and now is going to be redeveloped.  Resources for poor people are being reduced.  The replacement - mixed used commercial and higher end residential, with \"affordable\" housing mixed in - will mean a net loss of truly affordable units.Profanity Hill was named because of all the cussing of the lawyers and clerks who had to make the hike up the hill to get to the old courthouse. The book was written by Irene Burns Miller, the social worker who was charged with relocating the 1,000+ residents who were living there before the new Yesler Terrace housing could be built.  At the time, residents were sure that rich people were going to take over.  Now, 70 years later, it seems their fears were justified.In the early 1980s I was volunteering at Operation Nightwatch.  In those days, a single volunteer might find shelter for 30 or 40 homeless people from our office in the Seven Seas Hotel, above the Lusty Lady on First Avenue and University.

It sits like an orphan, surrounded by towers.)This particular night I was able to find shelter for everyone who came into Nightwatch, except the last two people - a couple.  I couldn\\'t find any shelter that could handle a couple, and the hotel voucher system was reserved for people with young children.

I decided to call. \"David, would you be willing to host a couple in your living room for one night?\"  I must have been crazy myself to suggest such an arrangement.  David was just fine with it - he was schizophrenic, but well regulated.

I told the couple about his problems, that he was pretty much okay, and this was only for one night.They probably slept better than I did.

As I was driving away, I wondered why it is so hard to find 2 volunteers to spend one night a month hosting 8 homeless guys.  Can you tell me why? Just so you know.  We deliver :)  In case you want to start something at your church or synagogue.\\n',\n",
       " 'Father Kim has been going on the street several times a month for the past 12 years.Like many ministers, he is bilingual.  He speaks Montanan English, and is also fluent in Episcopalian.  This is very handy for me, because Free Methodists are poorly schooled in Anglican idioms. Without Father Kim, I might never have known that a burse sits on top of the chalice, paten and veil, serves to hold a corporal and often hides an extra purificator. I recently asked Father Kim about the letters \"O.P.\" after a ministers name.  He told me he\\'d check with with his \"resident oblate.\"Oh. Perhaps every family should have an oblate.  I\\'m pretty sure I don\\'t have an oblate at my house, unless someone\\'s not telling me something, which is possible.His oblate emailed.  Apparently, O.P. is Latin for Ordo Praedicatorum.  I figured it out.  Can you?Thank you, Father Kim.  We have a lot of stories, you and I.\\n',\n",
       " \"For the past month, St. Mary's Catholic Church in Seattle has been taking eight guys from Operation Nightwatch, to sleep overnight. Every week, the same eight guys are hauled up the hill to Saint Mary's.  Two volunteers greet them.  Mats are layed out, guys sit around chatting, reading, settling in.  By 10:15 everyone - including the volunteers - are hunkered down.I drove away last Saturday night wondering why more congregations couldn't do something like that.  Once a week for a month, take eight guys.  Find two volunteers. Eight guys.  Pick a night of the week.  Try it for a month.  Two volunteers.  Coffee and a roll would be nice in the morning, but not required. It would mean eight fewer guys sleeping outside.  Think about it.\\n\",\n",

Beating back the mice and cockroaches was a steady occupation. My coworker KerriLyn and I were weary.  Nightwatch was straining to meet the needs of homeless people who were coming for help in ever-increasing numbers. There was a lull one afternoon.  Suddenly, KerriLyn started jumping up and down.   \"I need chocolate!\" she exclaimed, like some five-year old throwing a fit. Whatever.Maybe an hour later, a big Buick pulled up in the alley next to us.  The guy opened his trunk, to show us his donation. The trunk was stuffed with candy bars.   Enough for KerriLyn, and hundreds of homeless people.I can\\'t explain it without some reference to divine intervention.
